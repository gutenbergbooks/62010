<p class="no-indent bold center large p2">NICK CARTER STORIES</p>

<p class="no-indent bold center xxlarge">New Magnet Library</p>

<p class="no-indent bold center"><em>Not a Dull Book in This List</em></p>

<p class="no-indent bold center large p1">ALL BY NICHOLAS CARTER</p>


<p class="p2">Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The fact
that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely due to
the work of a specialist. The man who wrote these stories produced
no other type of fiction. His mind was concentrated upon the creation
of new plots and situations in which his hero emerged triumphantly
from all sorts of troubles and landed the criminal just where
he should be—behind the bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective stories
than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have been
selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend each of
them as being fully as interesting as any detective story between cloth
covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the New
Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise and delight
you.</p>

<small>A DOUBTFUL CLIENT.</small></h2>


<p>“Mr. Carter, can I trust you?”</p>

<p>It was in the great detective’s own house that this
question was asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” was Nick’s quiet answer, “if you had any doubt
on that matter, why did you come to me?”</p>

offend you.”</p>

on secrecy. It is so terribly important that I found it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
difficult to make up my mind to consult anybody on the
matter; and yet I know by your reputation that you are a
perfectly trustworthy man. There is nobody in the States
more so.”</p>

<p>While the man was speaking Nick was studying him.</p>

<p>In fact, the detective had been doing that from the
moment the man entered.</p>

<p>He was apparently about fifty years old; a well-dressed,
prosperous-looking man, who might be a merchant, or a
lawyer, or a banker.</p>

<p>Nick did no guessing. The man might be anything else.
He had given his name as George Snell, but he had not
sent in his card, and he had not said where he belonged.</p>

<p>Word had simply been taken to Nick by a servant that
a Mr. George Snell wanted to see him on “most important
business.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t an American,” was Nick’s only conclusion
from what had been said thus far. “An American would
not have spoken simply of ‘the States,’ as he did.”</p>

<p>There had been a pause after the caller’s last remarks.</p>

<p>“Well,” he exclaimed then, “I’m not coming more than
two-thirds of the way across the continent for nothing.
I set out to consult you, and I will do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s better,” said the detective; and, willing to help
him tell his story, he asked: “What kind of a case is it,
Mr. Snell?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’d call it kidnaping; but there’s robbery
combined with it, and—and also—also blackmail.”</p>

<p>Mr. Snell hesitated and stammered a little at the end of
this speech.</p>

<p>Nick merely nodded.</p>

<p>“To begin with,” continued Mr. Snell, “I come from
Wenonah. You may not be aware that the Government
of England has made a large section of Western British
America into a province and called it Wenonah.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nick, “I am aware of that.”</p>

<p>“You are a well-informed man. Few Americans would
know the fact, for the province is so young that it isn’t
down on the maps yet. You know, also, I suppose, that
the capital of the province is a town called Manchester?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That is where the crime was committed. It happened
a month ago. The governor of the province, Bradley is
his name, gave a party at his house. All the prominent
families of the town and country around attended. There
was dancing till a late hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then, when the guests were going away, it was discovered
that the governor’s daughter, Estelle, was missing.
She has not been seen since.”</p>

<p>“How old is the child?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Child?” echoed Mr. Snell, in apparent astonishment.
Then he seemed to understand, and added: “It is natural
that you should use that word, but the girl is twenty.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“She’s the governor’s only daughter, and heiress, therefore,
to his property, which is very great.”</p>

<p>“Has nothing been heard from her?”</p>

<p>“Indirectly, yes. Her captors have offered to restore
her for a ransom.”</p>

<p>“Has there been any attempt to deal with her captors?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but nothing has come of it. There is doubt now
whether she is really in the hands of kidnapers.”</p>

<p>“Ah! what then?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you the whole story, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Go on, then.”</p>

<p>“The day after she disappeared it was found that a
considerable amount of jewelry had gone also.”</p>

<p>“Did she wear it at the ball?”</p>

<p>“Some of it, most of it, in fact. But that was not all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
There were also missing certain State papers and some
private documents belonging to the governor. These are
extremely important. They must be recovered at any
cost.”</p>

<p>“Are they more important than the recovery of Miss
Bradley, Mr. Snell?”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t say that, but they complicate the case
badly. An offer has been made to restore them.”</p>

<p>“And the girl?”</p>

<p>“No. That is, there was one offer to restore the girl
and another to deal for the return of the papers and jewelry.
There seems to be a double gang of villains at
work.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. What about the blackmail you mentioned?”</p>

<p>“That,” answered Mr. Snell, hesitating, “has to do with
the stolen papers.”</p>

<p>“Something shady in the governor’s past?”</p>

<p>Mr. Snell looked at the floor.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to say,” he replied. “Some people
might think so.”</p>

<p>“Evidently the robbers do think so, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for they put a big price on the papers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose the matter has been investigated by the
police of Manchester?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then how did you communicate with the robbers?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that I had communicated with the robbers!”
exclaimed Mr. Snell, hastily.</p>

<p>“No, but I supposed it was you. Never mind that for a
moment. Tell me more about the disappearance of Miss
Bradley.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much that I can tell. She must have left
the house soon after midnight, but she wasn’t missed till
three hours or more later.”</p>

<p>“Was she engaged to be married?”</p>

<p>Snell looked sharply at the detective.</p>

<p>“You’re a keen one,” he said. “No, she wasn’t engaged,
and that is another complication.</p>

<p>“Well, it is known that she was in love with a young
fellow who wasn’t liked by her father. Naturally he
wasn’t at the ball. It is thought possible that she eloped
with him, and that the offer of the robbers to restore her
was a bluff.”</p>

<p>“Was her lover a rich man?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you think she may have taken the jewelry to
sell for her own use.”</p>

<p>“It’s possible, yes. I’ve thought of it.”</p>

<p>“And that the robbery of the papers simply happened
to come at the same time.”</p>

<p>“That might be.”</p>

<p>“Has Miss Bradley’s lover been seen since she disappeared?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What does he say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I should suppose he would say a good deal.”</p>

<p>“He goes about his business as usual, but he is under
constant watch. It’s plain enough that there is something
on his mind.”</p>

<p>“I should think there might be, in any case. What is
his name?”</p>

<p>“Cecil West.”</p>

<p>“And what is your relation to the affair, Mr. Snell?”</p>

<p>The visitor seemed startled.</p>

<p>“My relation to it?” he echoed.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Do you come here as the representative
of Governor Bradley?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no! not at all! the governor didn’t send me.”</p>

<p>“Who did, then?”</p>

<p>Snell looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Do you need an answer to that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course I do. I must know whom I am dealing
with.”</p>

<p>“But I gave my name——”</p>

<p>“It is not enough.”</p>

<p>The detective spoke rather sharply.</p>

<p>Mr. Snell hesitated and then said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, I cannot see why I should be dragged into
the matter at all——”</p>

<p>“But,” interrupted Nick, coldly, “nobody has dragged
you that I am aware of. I certainly didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You are trying to do so now, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>Nick arose.</p>

<p>“There is no need that we should talk longer,” he said.</p>

<p>Snell also stood up, and he looked very much troubled.</p>

<p>“I see that I have offended you,” he said. “I didn’t
mean to. You see, Mr. Carter, a great scandal might
come of this. It is very important that there should be
none. The governor’s position might be lost——”</p>

<p>“At this moment,” said Nick, “I care nothing for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
governor’s position. You have given me some facts in a
case that might be interesting, but I don’t propose to
tackle it unless I know what I am about.”</p>

<p>“We want you to look for the girl and the stolen
papers.”</p>

<p>“Who are we?”</p>

<p>Snell hung his head.</p>

<p>“Excuse me a moment,” said Nick; then: “I think I
heard the telephone ring. When I return I hope you will
have made up your mind to trust me. If you haven’t we
can’t do business.”</p>

<p>He bowed and left the room, but he did not go to the
telephone.</p>

<p>Instead he went to a room where Patsy, one of his assistants,
was reading and gave him a few rapid instructions.</p>

<p>Then he wrote a telegram and sent it to the nearest
office by a servant.</p>

<p>Patsy got his hat and went downstairs.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Snell,” said Nick, when he returned, “are
you ready to tell me what I want to know?”</p>

<p>“I can only say that I want you to act in behalf of the
governor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does he know that you came to New York to ask
this?”</p>

<p>Snell did not answer.</p>

<p>“We are wasting each other’s time,” said Nick.</p>

<p>Snell made a last appeal.</p>

<p>“I may be doing wrong,” he said, “but I beg you to look
into this matter. You can’t help seeing how important it
is.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Nick, “usually I have nothing to do
with a case where any facts are concealed from me——”</p>

<p>“I am concealing no facts.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, you refuse to answer one of the first
questions a detective would ask. I was going to say, Mr.
Snell, give me a few hours to think it over and come
again. Will you call to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>“Very well, till then.”</p>

<p>The detective went with his visitor to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Snell said “good-evening,” politely, and started
down the street.</p>

<p>A short distance behind him went Patsy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.
<br />
<small>MR. SNELL IN TROUBLE.</small></h2>


<p>Nick had not taken time to tell Patsy very much about
Snell.</p>

<p>“There’s something up,” he said to his assistant. “I
have no idea what it is, but I want you to shadow this
man and see what becomes of him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s a crook?” asked the young man.</p>

<p>“Not yet. He may be. If so, it won’t be the first time
that a crook has tried to throw me off the track by calling
on me. I simply feel that there’s something queer in this,
and I’d like to find out about it. So I shall ask this man
to call again unless he makes up his mind to tell me all
the facts.”</p>

<p>Snell refused to tell all the facts, and so Patsy slipped
out after him.</p>

<p>He had not gone far from the house when the young
detective became convinced that another man also was
following Snell.</p>

<p>This made his work very difficult, for he had to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
sharp against betraying himself not only to Snell, but the
other man.</p>

<p>Snell went into a drug store and bought a cigar.</p>

<p>The man who seemed to be following him loafed on the
opposite corner.</p>

<p>Patsy turned down a street, and dropped into a doorway,
where he made a swift change in his appearance.</p>

<p>He was at Snell’s heels again when the man from
Wenonah went on.</p>

<p>The other man seemed to have disappeared.</p>

<p>“I was mistaken,” thought Patsy, “or the second chap is
a better shadow than I am.”</p>

<p>For some blocks he kept up his chase, never losing sight
of Snell, and seeing nothing more of the other.</p>

<p>Meantime Snell was apparently wandering around aimlessly.</p>

<p>He would stop at a corner and wait a full minute before
he made up his mind which way to go.</p>

<p>Often he changed his direction.</p>

<p>In this way he got into a neighborhood which was very
quiet in the evening.</p>

<p>Part way down a block he stopped suddenly, stood still
for a moment and then went close to a building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>He was then in such deep shadow that Patsy could
not see him.</p>

<p>“Somebody spoke to him,” reasoned the detective.</p>

<p>He went cautiously closer, and before he could see anybody
he heard the sounds of voices in conversation.</p>

<p>What they said it was impossible to make out.</p>

<p>The detective dared not get close enough than that for
fear of attracting the attention of the men.</p>

<p>There seemed to be two of them.</p>

<p>Presently he heard one voice say:</p>

<p>“I won’t do it.”</p>

<p>One of the men started away.</p>

<p>“It will be the worse for you, then,” growled the other.</p>

<p>The first man hastened his steps.</p>

<p>As he came from the shadow, Patsy saw that it was
Snell.</p>

<p>The other man was darting after him on tiptoe.</p>

<p>He had one arm drawn back.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” thought Patsy, “he means murder!”</p>

<p>He gave up trying to conceal his actions then.</p>

<p>Running forward as fast as possible, he shouted:</p>

<p>“Look out!”</p>

<p>Snell turned quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The other man was close to him, and let his hand fall.</p>

<p>With a great leap Patsy was up to him just in time to
catch his arm.</p>

<p>But it was too late to stop the blow entirely.</p>

<p>A slungshot in the man’s hand slipped from it and
struck Snell a glancing blow on the head.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried, and staggered.</p>

<p>Patsy dashed to assist him, and caught hold of him in
time to prevent him from falling against an iron fence,
which probably would have broken his head.</p>

<p>The would-be murderer was dashing down the street.</p>

<p>Patsy could not be in two places at once.</p>

<p>He wanted to chase the unknown criminal, but his
first business was with Snell.</p>

<p>This was not only because Nick had sent him out to
shadow Snell, but because the man seemed to be badly
injured.</p>

<p>He was groaning and trembling so that he would have
fallen if the detective had not held him up.</p>

<p>“Better sit down a minute,” Patsy suggested, “and let
me see if there’s anything serious the matter.”</p>

<p>Snell sank to a doorstep, and Patsy made a quick examination
of his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was a nasty blow,” he said, “but I think your
skull is sound. Aren’t you feeling better?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Snell replied, “I am. I was more frightened
than hurt, perhaps. I am greatly obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. Let me help you to your house.
Do you live near?”</p>

<p>Snell laughed a little.</p>

<p>“Near!” he repeated, “I should say not.”</p>

<p>“Will you have a cab called to take you home?” asked
Patsy.</p>

<p>Again Snell laughed.</p>

<p>“It would be too long a journey,” he said. “I am a
stranger in New York, and I am staying at the Fifth
Avenue. That isn’t very far away, I believe.”</p>

<p>“No, and you can get a car at the next block, if you
want to.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather walk.”</p>

<p>He got up, and Patsy held his arm till they came to the
corner.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose your friend will tackle you again,”
said the detective, then: “but I haven’t anything to do,
and if you like I’ll walk with you to the hotel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are very kind,” Snell responded; “suppose you
do. I confess that I am very nervous.”</p>

<p>“He had it in for you, I suppose,” remarked Patsy.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to speak to this policeman about it?”</p>

<p>An officer was approaching.</p>

<p>“No! no!” exclaimed Snell, hastily; “I have my reasons
for keeping the matter quiet. Don’t for Heaven’s sake,
say a word.”</p>

<p>“All right. It’s no business of mine, but if any fellow
had thumped me like that I should want him put where
he couldn’t try it again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will try it again; at least, not in New
York. I’d rather not talk about it.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, sir. Want to stop in at a drug store
and get your head bathed with arnica?”</p>

<p>“That would be a good idea.”</p>

<p>They entered the next drug store they came to, where
it proved that Snell had suffered nothing more than a
painful bruise.</p>

<p>After that they went on to the Fifth Avenue Hotel.</p>

<p>“I am very much obliged to you,” said Snell, halting
in the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” Patsy responded.</p>

<p>“Will you come in and have something?”</p>

<p>He looked as if he hoped Patsy would say no, but the
detective was glad of any excuse to stick to him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Patsy, “don’t care if I do.”</p>

<p>Snell nodded silently, and led the way into the hotel.</p>

<p>As they were passing the desk the clerk spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Snell,” he said, “there’s a telegram here for you.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Snell to Patsy, going quickly to the
desk.</p>

<p>He took the envelope handed to him, and opened it with
trembling fingers.</p>

<p>When he had read the message he crumpled the paper
in his hand and frowned.</p>

<p>After a moment of thought, he turned to Patsy, saying,
“Excuse me” again, and went with him to the barroom.</p>

<p>Snell poured himself a stiff drink of whiskey.</p>

<p>“Once more,” he said, raising his glass, “I thank you
for coming to my rescue. Honestly, I believe I should
be a dead man this minute if you hadn’t. Here’s your
health.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” responded Patsy.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Snell, “I don’t like to leave a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
who has saved my life, in this abrupt way, but I’ve got to.
This telegram calls me out of town, and I must lose no
time in getting ready. Won’t you leave me your name
and address?”</p>

<p>“Why,” answered Patsy, “I’ll give you my name if you
want it, and address, too, but it isn’t likely that we shall
meet again if you don’t live in New York. My name is
James Callahan,” and he gave an address that the detectives
sometimes used.</p>

<p>It was a place where any letters that came to strange
names were promptly taken to Nick’s house.</p>

<p>Snell made a note of the address.</p>

<p>“My name is Snell,” he said, “and I hope we shall meet
again, Mr. Callahan. I must say good-by now.”</p>

<p>They shook hands and Snell went to the elevator.</p>

<p>“I wish he had dropped that telegram,” thought the
detective.</p>

<p>He looked at the clock. It was an hour and a half to
midnight. If Snell meant to leave town at once he
could hardly hope to do so until midnight, for that was
the hour at which through trains started from most
stations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>There was time to make a report to Nick and get back
again if that should be necessary.</p>

<p>Accordingly Patsy hurried to Nick’s house, and told
his chief what had happened.</p>

<p>Nick looked very thoughtful.</p>

<p>“I had about decided that the man is crazy,” he said.
“I sent a telegram to the chief of police at Manchester,
asking if he knew of any robbery of jewels, State papers,
or anything else of great importance within a month.
I also asked if there had been a mysterious disappearance
within the same time, and if he knew who George Snell
was. Here’s his answer, received five minutes ago.”</p>

<p>He handed a telegram to Patsy.</p>

<p>It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Nothing doing in crime here. Never heard of George
Snell. No man of that name lives here.</p>

<p class="signature">“<span class="smcap">Dinsmore.</span>”<br /></p>
</div>

<p>“Dinsmore,” said Nick, “is the chief at Manchester
now. He used to be on the New York force, and I know
him well. Now, if there has been a serious crime at Manchester,
two thousand miles away, isn’t it strange that I
should hear of it in New York before it is known there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“It beats me,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“And it looks as if Snell was the chief crook in the
matter,” added Nick. “But, if he is, I can’t see what he’s
driving at. After getting this telegram I thought he was
crazy, that he imagined a crime had been committed, and
I didn’t mean to have anything more to do with the
matter.</p>

<p>“Now I am interested. What you have told me shows
that there’s something up, something very mysterious.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better keep our eyes on it, Patsy.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Go back to the hotel and get on Snell’s track. Follow
him across the continent if necessary, and keep me
posted.”</p>

<p>“All right, boss.”</p>

<p>“Better take a cab. Leave your grip in it until you
know what station Snell is going to. Then stick to him
like a burr. There may be more attempts against his life.”</p>

<p>Patsy was gone in a minute.</p>

<p>When his cab halted at the Fifth Avenue he did not
leave it, for he saw Snell coming out.</p>

<p>The man got into a hotel carriage, and told the driver
to take him to the Pennsylvania Railroad station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>This was done, and, of course, Patsy followed.</p>

<p>Snell bought a ticket for Chicago, and Patsy, who stood
close behind him at the window, did the same.</p>

<p>They were almost side by side as they went to the ferry-boat,
Patsy, of course, so disguised that Snell did not
recognize him.</p>

<p>Snell went to the forward end of the boat and stood
near the rail.</p>

<p>The detective sat down in the men’s cabin.</p>

<p>Hardly had he taken his seat when a man came aboard
whom he had seen before.</p>

<p>It was the one whom he had suspected as shadowing
Snell from Nick Carter’s house.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.
<br />
<small>A GAME OF WATCHING.</small></h2>


<p>Patsy thought that this was the same man who had
come so near killing Snell.</p>

<p>He had not been sure of that at the time, for he had
not been able to see the would-be murderer’s face.</p>

<p>Now it took only a sharp glance to satisfy him, for the
man’s motions were a little peculiar.</p>

<p>He had a way of bending his head to one side which
Patsy had noticed in the man who had shadowed Snell.</p>

<p>As he remembered it the same sideways hang of the
head had been the case with the would-be murderer in
that instant when he saw him darting after his victim.</p>

<p>“So,” thought Patsy, “he’s at his game again. Been
watching Snell, probably, ever since the attack. There’ll
be trouble if he finds his man on board.”</p>

<p>Nothing could have been plainer than that the man
was looking for somebody.</p>

<p>He went part way through the cabin, giving stealthy,
side glances at the men on the seats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>When he came to the doorway that led to the upper
deck, he went up.</p>

<p>“He won’t find Snell up there, I think,” said Patsy
to himself, as he got up and went forward.</p>

<p>The detective went as far as the door that opened upon
the forward deck.</p>

<p>Looking through it, he saw Snell leaning against the
rail.</p>

<p>Nobody else was out there.</p>

<p>At that moment the boat had hardly got beyond the end
of the ferry slip.</p>

<p>Patsy sat down where he could look the length of the
men’s cabin and also glance through the glass in the
door at the forward deck.</p>

<p>In less than a minute he saw the stranger coming down
the stairs from the upper cabin.</p>

<p>He was still walking slowly, and peering sharply at the
passengers.</p>

<p>When he had come as far as the door, he halted and
looked through the glass.</p>

<p>The detective could see his face.</p>

<p>He saw the man’s brow wrinkle first when he perceived
that somebody was standing alone by the rail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Then his lips were pressed hard together, and he nodded
as if satisfied.</p>

<p>Evidently he had recognized Snell.</p>

<p>For a moment longer he stood there, hesitating, perhaps.</p>

<p>Then he gave a side glance at Patsy, who sat so close
that they almost touched each other.</p>

<p>The detective seemed to be deeply engaged in reading a
placard hung on the opposite wall.</p>

<p>The man softly opened the door and went out.</p>

<p>Patsy was on his feet instantly.</p>

<p>Looking through the glass, he saw the stranger slink
into the darkness by the side wall of the boat, there
being a space thus shut in between the cabin door and the
open deck where Snell stood looking at the water.</p>

<p>“What a chance,” thought Patsy, “to sneak up and
pitch his man overboard!”</p>

<p>The stranger stood motionless a moment.</p>

<p>Then he edged forward.</p>

<p>At that Patsy quietly opened the door and stepped out.</p>

<p>The man did not hear him.</p>

<p>His attention was too much taken with what he was
going to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Snell was motionless.</p>

<p>The boat was about in midstream.</p>

<p>Patsy’s muscles quivered as the stranger glided swiftly
up and placed his hand on Snell’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Snell whirled around, with a gasp of surprise and
alarm.</p>

<p>He put up his hands to push the man away, and tried
to back from the rail.</p>

<p>The stranger kept his hand firmly on Snell’s shoulder.</p>

<p>For a second or two the men jostled each other, but it
could not be said that they were struggling.</p>

<p>The stranger seemed merely trying to hold Snell still.</p>

<p>Patsy heard him say:</p>

<p>“Keep quiet! I am not going to hurt you!”</p>

<p>Evidently Snell was somewhat relieved at this, but he
was still frightened.</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to have you arrested,” he said.</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>“You’ll think better of that as soon as you see a policeman,”
he retorted.</p>

<p>“You’ve tried to kill me once to-night,” said Snell.</p>

<p>“Well, let that pass. I didn’t succeed, and now that
you’re starting West I shan’t try again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you want of me now?”</p>

<p>“I want to talk with you.”</p>

<p>“On the same subject?”</p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p>Snell gave a hasty glance at the river.</p>

<p>“Think of jumping in?” sneered the stranger.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Snell, with a shudder.</p>

<p>Then he looked back toward the cabin, and saw Patsy.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was perceived, the detective walked
easily forward and stood looking at the lights of Jersey
City.</p>

<p>“This is no place,” said Snell, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Of course not. I’ll go on the train with you.”</p>

<p>Snell started uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“I presume,” the other went on, with a harsh chuckle,
“that you engaged a stateroom on the sleeper, and thought
that you would lock yourself in and so be safe for the
night. Fortunately, there’s room for two in a stateroom.”</p>

<p>At this, Snell said nothing, but went back to the cabin.</p>

<p>The other followed, and both went inside.</p>

<p>“Well!” thought Patsy, “this is a puzzler, and no mistake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Are they both crooks? and have they had a falling
out?</p>

<p>“One is certainly a would-be murderer, and Snell is
plainly in great fear of him.</p>

<p>“I should think he would be.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they will actually occupy the same room
on the train?”</p>

<p>They did.</p>

<p>Snell, as the stranger had said, had engaged a stateroom,
and both went into it immediately on going aboard
the train.</p>

<p>Patsy secured a berth in the same car, and, as he
turned in he wondered whether one man or two would
come out of that stateroom in the morning.</p>

<p>It seemed to him most likely that the stranger would
make an attempt to murder Snell during the night.</p>

<p>“If it were my business to take care of Snell,” thought
the detective, “I’d invent some way to do it; but it isn’t,
and I’ll just wait and see what happens.”</p>

<p>With that thought he went to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning he touched the button beside his berth
before getting up.</p>

<p>When the porter came he asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there a dining car on the train, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Yessah,” replied the porter. “Breakfast will be ready
in twenty minutes, sah.”</p>

<p>“All right; then I’ll get up.”</p>

<p>“Sumfin else yo’ want, sah?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Put your head in here, Charley?”</p>

<p>The porter put his head in between the curtains.</p>

<p>“Have the gentlemen in the stateroom turned out yet?”
asked Patsy.</p>

<p>“No, sah; ain’t seed nuffin’ of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Were they quiet all night?”</p>

<p>“Yassah. Leastwise, I didn’t hear nuffin.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Friends of yours, sah?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but I’m curious about them, that’s all.
You needn’t say I asked any questions.”</p>

<p>“No, sah—thank yo’ berry much, sah. Won’t say a
word.”</p>

<p>The porter had received handsome pay for his silence,
and Patsy knew he could be trusted.</p>

<p>He dressed and went forward to the dining car.</p>

<p>As he passed Snell’s stateroom, he listened for the sound
of voices, but none came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective wondered if there was one man in that
room who couldn’t speak.</p>

<p>Having plenty of time to kill, he spent an hour at the
breakfast table.</p>

<p>Before he was ready to go, in came Snell and the
stranger.</p>

<p>They sat at the same table and appeared to be in good
spirits—at least, the stranger was.</p>

<p>Snell looked rather haggard, but he talked with his
companion, and without any apparent fear of him.</p>

<p>“Strange!” thought Patsy; “but I’m glad my man is
still alive. I want to find out what it all means.”</p>

<p>He went to the smoker, and after he had been there
half an hour or so, Snell and the stranger came in also.</p>

<p>They did not talk much as they smoked their cigars,
but no one would have guessed that one had tried to kill
the other less than twelve hours before.</p>

<p>So it was all the way to Chicago.</p>

<p>The two men were together all the time, and there was
hardly a minute that the detective did not have them in
view.</p>

<p>It was early morning when the train arrived in Chicago.</p>

<p>Snell and his companion got into a cab, and Patsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
heard them tell the driver to go to the Northwestern
station.</p>

<p>Patsy arrived at the station at the same moment they
did.</p>

<p>They breakfasted in the station restaurant, and after a
time they went to the ticket window.</p>

<p>Snell bought a ticket for Helena, Montana.</p>

<p>The stranger did not buy any.</p>

<p>This also seemed somewhat strange, and the detective
was a little disappointed.</p>

<p>He had hoped to keep them together.</p>

<p>But he bought a ticket for Helena, and in due time
was again on the same train with Snell.</p>

<p>The stranger stayed at the station until the train left,
and Patsy saw him on the platform as it rolled out.</p>

<p>Nothing of importance happened on the rest of the way
to Helena.</p>

<p>Once the detective tried to scrape acquaintance with
Snell, but the latter answered him in a surly way, and
made it plain that he did not care to talk to anybody.</p>

<p>So Patsy gave it up for fear of making him suspicious.</p>

<p>Meantime, he had telegraphed Nick as to where he was
going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>When they arrived in Helena, Snell did not go to a
first-rate hotel, as he had done in New York, but walked
about the streets, as if looking for some place that he
had been sent to.</p>

<p>It was pretty clear that he was a stranger in the city.</p>

<p>At last he turned into a small building, on which there
was a rough sign, with these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">BRONCO BILL’S HOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>The place was hardly larger than an ordinary saloon,
and liquor selling certainly was its principal business.</p>

<p>Patsy went in a moment after Snell.</p>

<p>He found himself in a cheap barroom, where a few men
were loafing.</p>

<p>Snell was at one end of the bar, talking in a low voice
with one who seemed to be the proprietor.</p>

<p>The detective took his place at the other end of the
bar and called for a drink.</p>

<p>A moment later, Snell and the proprietor went out by
a door at the back, and he heard their steps going up a
flight of stairs.</p>

<p>They were gone but a minute, and when they returned,
Snell was saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“It may be only two or three days, you know, and I can
get along all right. I’ll pay for the room for a week,
anyway.”</p>

<p>With this, he took bills from his pocket, and gave
money to the proprietor, who responded:</p>

<p>“O.K., then the place is yours.”</p>

<p>Then the landlord invited Snell to have a drink, and
Snell accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Patsy, “I shall have to find another
place to stay. Bronco Bill evidently isn’t used to having
guests in real hotel fashion, and two at a time would make
him and everybody else suspicious.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t put up any sort of a yarn that would satisfy
them. So I’ll get a room somewhere else, and then drop
in here when I feel like it.</p>

<p>“That will be safe enough, for it looks sure that Snell
is bound to stay for a while.”</p>

<p>As the detective left the saloon, he saw a sign in the
window of a house opposite:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">ROOMS TO LET.</p>
</div>

<p>“That will do,” he decided, “but not just yet.”</p>

<p>He was fearful that Snell might be watching him, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
he could not tell how suspicious that strange man might
be.</p>

<p>So he walked around town a little while, made a complete
change in his disguise, and finally returned to the
lodging house opposite Bronco Bill’s.</p>

<p>There he hired a room that had a window opening on
the street, at which he sat for some time, with his face
hidden behind the curtain.</p>

<p>He saw enough to know that Snell was still at the
“hotel,” and he was satisfied.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, Snell went out.</p>

<p>The detective followed, of course.</p>

<p>At first Snell did not seem to have any errand. He
seemed to be walking for exercise.</p>

<p>But at last he stopped and looked in at a store window.</p>

<p>Rifles, revolvers, and all sorts of things that hunters
need were displayed there.</p>

<p>Snell went in, and Patsy, looking in at the window, saw
him buy a revolver.</p>

<p>With this in his pocket, the strange man returned to
Bronco Bill’s and disappeared within.</p>

<p>That evening the detective loafed away most of the
time in Bronco Bill’s barroom, but he did not see Snell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>There was the ordinary crowd of idle workingmen,
and a few roughs who evidently came in from ranches at a
distance, but there was no disorder; none of the men
seemed to be crooks, and nothing happened to throw any
light on Snell’s business in Helena.</p>

<p>It was much the same the next day and evening.</p>

<p>Snell took a long walk, but spoke to no one on the
way, and when he returned he apparently shut himself in
the room he had hired.</p>

<p>He came into the barroom late during the evening,
but it was only to have a drink, and go upstairs again at
once.</p>

<p>“Who’s the stranger, Bill?” asked one of the loafers.</p>

<p>“How should I know?” was the surly response. “A
gent comes to my house an’ takes a room an’ pays for it
like a gent. Why should I ask him if his father went to
church reg’lar, or if he intends to start a faro bank?”</p>

<p>“Do you think he does mean to start a faro bank, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Aw, come off!” returned Bill, scornfully. “Can’t you
take a hint? I don’t know the gent’s business, and, if I
did, I shouldn’t shoot off my mouth about it.”</p>

<p>Next day, Snell took several walks, but they were short
ones. He always returned quickly to Bill’s, and once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Patsy heard him ask the landlord if anybody had inquired
for him.</p>

<p>Nobody had, but it was clear that Snell’s business,
whatever it was, was coming to a head.</p>

<p>In the evening quite a number of men galloped through
the streets on horseback.</p>

<p>They shouted and sang songs and made a good deal of
a racket at every place they visited.</p>

<p>By the time they arrived at Bronco Bill’s they were
well loaded and noisier than ever.</p>

<p>“Paint the place red,” yelled half a dozen of them, as
they came stamping in.</p>

<p>Patsy was standing at the farther end of the bar talking
with Bill, with whom he had picked up acquaintance.</p>

<p>Snell was seated at a table in the corner nearest the
door.</p>

<p>“Everybody have a drink!” shouted the leader of the
party, looking around the room.</p>

<p>All except Snell got up and went to the bar.</p>

<p>“Come on, stranger,” yelled the leader.</p>

<p>Snell, seeing that he was spoken to, got up slowly and
started toward the bar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>His face was pale, and it was evident to Patsy that he
wished he were not there.</p>

<p>When he was halfway to the bar he turned suddenly
and made for the stairway door.</p>

<p>He passed through quickly, closed the door behind him,
and all in the room heard the click of the lock as he
turned the key.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be durned!” exclaimed the leader.</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew a revolver from his belt, and, with
the quick motions of a Westerner, pointed it toward the
door.</p>

<p>But he was not so quick as Patsy, who darted forward
and knocked his arm up.</p>

<p>The revolver went off, but the bullet, instead of crashing
through the door and thus endangering Snell’s life,
flew into the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Now then, gents,” began Bronco Bill, who didn’t want
a disturbance in his place.</p>

<p>The leader was too mad to be stopped by talk.</p>

<p>Turning fiercely upon Patsy, he demanded:</p>

<p>“What in thunder do you mean, tenderfoot?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid you might hurt somebody,” responded
the detective, quietly; “then you’d be sorry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sorry! me sorry!” roared the ruffian; “reckon you
don’t know who you’re talking to. I’m Serpent Sam, of
the Dead Hills, I am, and no man tells me what I shall or
shan’t do. I’ll make you dance for your impudence, you
measly tenderfoot!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.
<br />
<small>PATSY’S DANCING LESSON.</small></h2>


<p>Serpent Sam, as he called himself, backed into the
middle of the room as he spoke.</p>

<p>The other men in the crowd yelled with joy, and got
together at the other end of the bar from Patsy, most of
them.</p>

<p>A few stood almost behind their leader.</p>

<p>They were grinning at the fun they thought they were
going to have with the tenderfoot.</p>

<p>Patsy thrust his hands in the side pockets of his coat,
and watched, as if with curiosity.</p>

<p>He knew exactly what would happen, for he had met
wild men from the Western hills before.</p>

<p>So, when Serpent Sam blazed at his feet, he did not stir.</p>

<p>The first bullet tore a hole in the floor, just in front
of his right toe.</p>

<p>“Dance, you onery cuss! dance!” yelled Serpent Sam.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how,” replied Patsy.</p>

<p>“Jump then, you idiot! jump into the air, durn ye! I’ll
teach ye!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke, Serpent Sam fired again.</p>

<p>This time the bullet struck so close to the detective’s
foot that it jarred it.</p>

<p>But no harm was done, and Patsy never stirred.</p>

<p>He knew that the first shots would be aimed so as to
scare him—not to hit.</p>

<p>After that, Serpent Sam might be angered into firing
to kill.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, stranger,” called Bronco Bill,
“don’t be a fool. Dance for the gentleman. It won’t last
long, and nobody will be hurt. Jump and let him have his
fun.”</p>

<p>Patsy himself saw by the savage glare in Serpent Sam’s
eyes that it would be jump or get hit at the next shot.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, therefore, without moving from his
place, and before Serpent Sam could cock his revolver
again, Patsy drew one of his own barkers and fired.</p>

<p>Nobody in the room knew what he was about till they
heard the bang! and saw the puff of smoke that rolled
away from in front of the detective.</p>

<p>“I don’t dance for anybody,” said Patsy, quietly.</p>

<p>“Wow! ouch! damn!” howled Serpent Sam, as his
revolver flew from his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Patsy’s bullet had struck it on the butt.</p>

<p>It not only caused Serpent Sam to drop the weapon,
but it numbed his fingers.</p>

<p>And the bullet did another thing.</p>

<p>Glancing from the place where it struck Sam’s revolver,
it flew across the room and hit another man on the cartridge
belt, doing no harm, but startling that man fearfully.</p>

<p>For that matter, all the men were startled.</p>

<p>Some of them ran behind the bar and crouched down.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of those who had been in the place when
the horsemen came ran for the outside door.</p>

<p>Serpent Sam, cursing with rage and pain, reached for
his other revolver.</p>

<p>He could bend his numbed fingers just enough to draw
it from his belt, but he could not cock it.</p>

<p>While he was trying to do so, it dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>The fingers of his right hand would not hold it.</p>

<p>Patsy, knowing that he was disabled, was paying no
attention to him.</p>

<p>He was sweeping his revolver carelessly around the
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“It might go off,” he remarked. “It’s got a hair trigger.
Look out!”</p>

<p>At that his weapon did go off.</p>

<p>One of the men was just getting the drop on him.</p>

<p>Patsy’s shot did for him just what had been done for
Serpent Sam.</p>

<p>It knocked the gun out of his hand and caused him to
leap back, cursing with rage.</p>

<p>“If you gents enjoy dancing,” said Patsy, coolly, “just
recollect that I’m floor manager here. I’ll tell you when
it’s your turn—yours, for instance.”</p>

<p>With this he let drive at the feet of a man near the
edge of the crowd.</p>

<p>The bullets splintered the floor at the man’s toe.</p>

<p>He jumped for fear, and the detective laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s more fun than I thought,” he cried; “we’ll try it
again.”</p>

<p>He made as if he would empty all his cartridges at the
men’s feet, but he had done enough.</p>

<p>All except Serpent Sam were making a wild scramble
to get behind the bar, out of doors, underneath tables—any
place, so as to be out of range.</p>

<p>Sam had cooled down very suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on, stranger,” he called; “we uns know when
we’re licked. You’ve done us brown, an’ ef thar’s anything
in the house you want, call for it.”</p>

<p>Patsy understood the man.</p>

<p>His tone and manner showed that he meant what he
said.</p>

<p>He was rubbing his sore hand and kicking his revolvers
so that they would lie where he could pick them up.</p>

<p>Of all the men there Sam was the only one who hadn’t
shown fear.</p>

<p>The detective immediately pocketed his weapon.</p>

<p>“All right, pard,” he said, good-naturedly; “there is
one thing in the house I want.”</p>

<p>“Name it.”</p>

<p>“I want every man jack of you to wet up. The drinks
are on me, gents. Step lively.”</p>

<p>For an instant nobody stirred.</p>

<p>They looked at him as if they could not believe their
ears.</p>

<p>Those who had crouched behind the bar gradually
began to poke their heads above it.</p>

<p>Naturally, Serpent Sam was the first to move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving his revolvers where they were on the floor,
he strode to Patsy with his hand outstretched.</p>

<p>“Put it there, pard,” he cried; “you’re a white man an’
no mistake. I see I don’t need to ’pologize fer trying to
hev some fun with yer.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Patsy, shaking the man’s hand.</p>

<p>Sam winced, for the detective’s grip hurt his sore
fingers.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Patsy, letting go; “I didn’t think.”</p>

<p>Then both laughed, and at that sound the other men
came crowding up.</p>

<p>“Whar’d you learn to shoot?” asked one.</p>

<p>“Say, are you a walking Gatling gun?” inquired another.</p>

<p>Patsy smiled at them.</p>

<p>“I never learned to shoot,” he said. “I was born with
a gun in my hand, and I used to practice at the flies on
the wall before I could walk.”</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at this.</p>

<p>Bronco Bill drew a long breath.</p>

<p>The shooting scrap had turned out pleasantly, with nobody
the worse for it, and everybody thirsty.</p>

<p>Glasses rattled on the bar, and bottles passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here’s how, pard,” said Sam.</p>

<p>He drained his glass at one gulp, and set it down.</p>

<p>“But say,” he added, “you’d oughter hev let us make
the other cuss dance. Friend of yourn?”</p>

<p>“No. I saw that he was scared half to death, and I
was afraid he might have a fit.”</p>

<p>“Rot! he’d ’a’ got over it. Jine us now, won’t ye, pard,
and rout him out?”</p>

<p>“We’ll let you do the shootin’,” said another, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Now, gents,” began Bronco Bill, fearful that the rough
crowd would break loose again.</p>

<p>He didn’t know Patsy.</p>

<p>“Rout him out?” echoed the detective; “why! he’s a
mile from here by this time.”</p>

<p>“Go on!”</p>

<p>“That’s what he’s doing. Bet your life on it.”</p>

<p>“We might break down the door and see,” somebody
suggested.</p>

<p>Several of them began to move toward the door.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” called Patsy.</p>

<p>He was smiling, and they stopped to hear what he had
to say.</p>

<p>“I’d rather you wouldn’t bother the fellow,” he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
on; “I tell you that straight, but if you’re dead anxious
to have some fun with him and want me to join, I’ll take
the chance of a toss-up. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“It’s a go!” cried Sam, taking a coin from his pocket.
“Heads or tails, pard?”</p>

<p>“Is it a cent?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“No—a dime.”</p>

<p>“Just as good. Throw it up to the ceiling, and if it
comes down what you call yourself, I’ll join you.”</p>

<p>Serpent Sam tossed up the coin.</p>

<p>“Tails!” he called.</p>

<p>It struck the ceiling with a ting, and began to fall.</p>

<p>The detective’s revolver flashed, to the great surprise
of all, for they were watching the coin.</p>

<p>Crack! bang! went the trusty barker twice in rapid
order.</p>

<p>There was another ting at the further side of the room.</p>

<p>Sam went over there, and, after hunting a bit, picked
up the dime.</p>

<p>He came back to the bar with it, his face fairly blue with
wonder.</p>

<p>“Durned ef the stranger hain’t won,” he said; “the
dime hain’t got either a head or a tail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>He laid the coin on the bar, and everybody crowded
around to look at it.</p>

<p>Patsy’s first bullet had struck it on one side and his
second on the other, for the coin was spinning in the air
and luck was with him to the extent that both bullets did
not hit the same side.</p>

<p>“Wal! ef that ain’t the durnedest shootin’ ever I seen!”
said one of the men.</p>

<p>All agreed with him.</p>

<p>“It means,” said Sam, gravely, “that we let the white-livered
cuss upstairs alone. But you must come with us
to the next joint, pardner.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Patsy, “lead on.”</p>

<p>“An’ you’ll hev to make some galoot dance soon as we
find one of the right kind.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead. I’m agreed.”</p>

<p>The whole mob charged for the door.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk they paused to decide which way to go.</p>

<p>The street was not well lighted, and, while they were
talking, Patsy slipped a beard to his face.</p>

<p>“We’ll go to Danny Dineen’s next,” said Serpent Sam.
“Come on, pard——”</p>

<p>He looked around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’s the sharpshooter?” he asked.</p>

<p>Patsy pointed down the street.</p>

<p>“He’s just scooted that way,” he said, in a disguised
tone.</p>

<p>“Durned ef I don’t believe he’s tryin’ to shake us!”
cried Serpent Sam; “come on, boys, let’s catch up with
him.”</p>

<p>Off they went, yelling like mad, some jumping to their
horses, others on foot.</p>

<p>When they had all disappeared around a corner, Patsy
took off his beard and went back into Bronco Bill’s.</p>

<p>Bill and his bartender were alone in the place.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Bill, “where’d you come
from?”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d say good-night,” responded Patsy,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you go with that crowd?”</p>

<p>“You see.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I don’t see how you done it, but you done me and
my house a good turn, pardner. Gee! I thought they’d
shoot the whole outfit to pieces. Have something?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. When they find that I’ve given them
the shake, they may come back here, and if they find me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it won’t be so easy to get rid of them again. Tell ’em
you don’t know where I went.”</p>

<p>“All right, no more I do. Call again?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p>The detective then went out and crossed the street to
his lodging.</p>

<p>He sat at his window for more than an hour.</p>

<p>He saw the horsemen return after a time, heard them
singing and shouting in Bronco Bill’s, but he heard no
more shooting, and he saw no more of Snell that night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.
<br />
<small>CAUGHT IN THE HILLS.</small></h2>


<p>Next morning, in a fresh disguise, Patsy went over to
Bronco Bill’s and saw Snell eating breakfast.</p>

<p>The detective felt relieved.</p>

<p>He had feared that the man might have been so frightened
by the drunken horseman as to light out.</p>

<p>Patsy had now been studying the man for several days.</p>

<p>“I can’t make him out,” he said to himself, “but I don’t
believe he’s a regular crook.”</p>

<p>The detective was inclined to think that Snell had been
up to crooked work, but that he was new to it.</p>

<p>He went back to his lodging almost at once, and
watched.</p>

<p>Snell came to the door of Bronco Bill’s and stood there
a moment, looking up and down the street.</p>

<p>“He wants to walk for exercise,” thought the waiting
detective, “but he doesn’t dare to get far away, for he’s expecting
somebody. I won’t bother to follow him.”</p>

<p>So Snell that morning took his walks alone.</p>

<p>They were not long ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>He was always back at Bronco Bill’s within ten minutes
from the time he started.</p>

<p>At length he went in and stayed there.</p>

<p>Patsy went across and looked in long enough to see
that Snell had found an old book somewhere, and was
reading it in the barroom.</p>

<p>It was almost noon when the man Snell had been expecting
came.</p>

<p>The detective knew it before Snell did.</p>

<p>Watching from his window, he saw a man come rapidly
up from the direction of the railroad.</p>

<p>He walked as if he knew where he was going, and
he turned in at Bronco Bill’s.</p>

<p>It was the stranger who had come so near to murdering
Snell a short time before in New York City.</p>

<p>“Now we’re getting down to business!” thought Patsy,
with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>It had been a long wait, and he was a little tired of it.</p>

<p>Every day he had sent a telegram to Nick, saying,
simply: “No change,” or “Nothing doing.”</p>

<p>Meantime, he had received no word from his chief.</p>

<p>So he knew that there was nothing for him to do but
stay there and watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, he crossed over to the saloon soon after the
stranger went in.</p>

<p>He was disguised so that neither knew him, and Bronco
Bill did not suspect that the man who asked for a cigar
was the one who had done the wonderful shooting the
night before.</p>

<p>Snell and the stranger were eating dinner at a table
in the corner.</p>

<p>They did no talking.</p>

<p>Patsy returned to his watching place.</p>

<p>After dinner, the stranger went away alone.</p>

<p>The detective would have liked to follow, but it was his
business to spot Snell.</p>

<p>So he stayed where he was.</p>

<p>Some three hours passed, and then the stranger returned.</p>

<p>He went into the saloon, and almost immediately came
out again with Snell.</p>

<p>They walked away rapidly.</p>

<p>Patsy was after them.</p>

<p>Thinking that there might be some such excursion as
this, the detective had bought a horse.</p>

<p>The animal was stabled a few doors from his lodging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
house, where he could be got quickly, and he was kept
saddled all the time.</p>

<p>But there was no use for him on this trip.</p>

<p>The men walked through the city, and they acted as if
they were in a hurry, but they walked, and Patsy thought
it better to follow them in the same way.</p>

<p>As long as they were in busy streets he had no difficulty
in keeping close to them.</p>

<p>When they came to a long street, where the houses were
scattered, he fell a little further behind.</p>

<p>And at last they were in the open country, with no
house at all in sight ahead.</p>

<p>Then the detective had to be very cautious.</p>

<p>He decided to get into a field alongside the road, where
he could dodge behind bushes.</p>

<p>It was well he took this precaution when he did.</p>

<p>He had hardly left the road when both men wheeled
about suddenly.</p>

<p>They stood for a full minute, looking back toward the
city.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that some sudden fear of pursuit
had made them turn.</p>

<p>Patsy stooped behind a low bush and waited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>At last they went on, but Snell turned frequently, and
Patsy was kept on the dodge all the time.</p>

<p>This continued for two miles or more.</p>

<p>By then the road had brought them to hilly land, and
the detective was thinking that his pursuit would be
easier, when the two turned aside and began to climb a
steep hill.</p>

<p>It was covered with trees, and there was no path.</p>

<p>Dead wood was on the ground everywhere.</p>

<p>A man’s footsteps could be heard a long way, no matter
how carefully he proceeded.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was not possible any longer to keep the
men in sight.</p>

<p>Patsy took the chance of cutting across ahead of where
the men seemed to be aiming for.</p>

<p>In this way he thought he might come to the top of
the hill before they did.</p>

<p>Perhaps he succeeded. He could not tell, for, when
he got to the hilltop, they were not to be seen.</p>

<p>He waited a bit, and listened for a sound of their voices,
or footsteps, but heard nothing.</p>

<p>The hill dipped steeply on the other side, and there were
many hills beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very wild place, only partly wooded, and there
seemed to be deep gullies in every direction.</p>

<p>“They didn’t come out here for their health,” thought
Patsy. “It was to meet somebody.</p>

<p>“Probably that somebody is waiting in one of these
gullies.</p>

<p>“Which one?</p>

<p>“It’s almost as good a place for hiding as a big city is.”</p>

<p>After some little thought he went part way down the
hill, then along the side until he came near the edge of a
ravine.</p>

<p>While he was cautiously approaching the edge, he
heard a laugh somewhere below him.</p>

<p>In the ravine, undoubtedly.</p>

<p>Then that was where the men had gone.</p>

<p>Patsy saw a rock a short distance away, from behind
which he thought he might be able to look down into the
ravine without being seen.</p>

<p>A few cautious steps and he was beside it.</p>

<p>Leaning far over it, he found that he had chosen the
spot luckily; for a little way below him he saw a group
of men, most of them roughly dressed.</p>

<p>Among them were Snell and his strange companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>They were talking earnestly.</p>

<p>At that moment, Snell’s companion was speaking, and
the others were listening.</p>

<p>His words came faintly to Patsy’s ears.</p>

<p>“I tell you,” he said, “we’re ready to pay the price, but
you’ve got to deliver the goods. There’s nothing unfair
in that. We’ve come out here to tell you so, but you can’t
deliver the goods here, can you?”</p>

<p>“That’ll be all right,” said one of the rough men.</p>

<p>“Oh! will it? How do we know?” demanded Snell’s
companion. “We don’t propose to put our feet into a
trap.”</p>

<p>At this some of the men laughed hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Supposin’,” suggested one of them, “we don’t let you
get out of this gulch alive?”</p>

<p>Snell could be seen to start uncomfortably.</p>

<p>His companion was unmoved.</p>

<p>“In that case,” he retorted, “you’d leave a couple of
worthless stiffs here for the crows to pick. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you haven’t brought the stuff with
you?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, exactly.”</p>

<p>“Then what the dev——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why!” interrupted Snell’s companion, “we’re here to
let you know that we’re acting on the square. Prove that
you’re on the square, too, and we can do business.”</p>

<p>The men looked at each other.</p>

<p>“Don’t like it,” grumbled one.</p>

<p>“Well,” said another, the youngest in the party, “I
think they’ve got the best of the argument. Here they
are, just as they agreed to be. They haven’t gone to any
detectives, and it’s our business now to hand over the
goods——”</p>

<p>Patsy was greatly interested, wondering whether this
young man would persuade the gang to his way of thinking,
when, without the least warning, strong hands were
laid upon him.</p>

<p>He turned like a flash at the first touch.</p>

<p>His hand raised the revolver that he had been clutching
from the moment when he lay down behind the rock.</p>

<p>But there was no use in firing it.</p>

<p>The bullet wouldn’t have hit anybody.</p>

<p>His assailants had every advantage of him.</p>

<p>He had been caught by both feet and yanked backward.</p>

<p>Others had grabbed him by the arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Still another dropped a noose over his head and pulled
it tight.</p>

<p>A little more strain on that rope, and the detective
would have been choked to death.</p>

<p>In much less time than it takes to tell it, they had him
with his hands securely bound behind his back.</p>

<p>The detective was helpless.</p>

<p>And up to this moment, nobody had said a word, and
no sound of the capture had reached the ears of the men
in the ravine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.
<br />
<small>PATSY IS FORCED TO SLEEP.</small></h2>


<p>When they had him bound to their satisfaction, Patsy’s
captors laid him on his back and looked him over.</p>

<p>He saw, too late, how it had happened.</p>

<p>Close to the rock was a thick bunch of bushes.</p>

<p>His judgment had been perfect, for it had taken him to
the exact spot where there was an easy way down to the
gulch.</p>

<p>It was the way these men always took to get there.</p>

<p>But, unluckily for the detective, they had posted sentinels
at that spot.</p>

<p>His captors had been within reach of him from the moment
he arrived.</p>

<p>Why they had not attacked him at once could only be
guessed.</p>

<p>Probably they were so surprised that they didn’t know
what to do at first.</p>

<p>And maybe they thought he might be a prospector,
or anybody but a detective, who would go away as soon
as he had taken a look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wal, by gosh!” muttered one who seemed to be the
leader of the sentinels, “I reckon this’ll make some difference
with what they’re jawin’ about down thar.”</p>

<p>Patsy tried a bluff.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what you mean,” he began, indignantly.
“I haven’t done anything to you——”</p>

<p>“And we won’t do a thing to you,” interrupted the
leader, harshly—“oh, no! we won’t tech ye! Pick him up,
boys.”</p>

<p>Two of the men took Patsy on their shoulders, and
they went stumbling down the side of the gulch.</p>

<p>Snell and the others looked up in the greatest surprise
when they heard the sentinels coming.</p>

<p>All the men got to their feet, for some had been sitting,
and guns were shown freely.</p>

<p>“What ye got thar?” demanded the chief of the gang.</p>

<p>“A spy,” replied the leader of the sentinels.</p>

<p>“Find him up thar?”</p>

<p>“Yes—behind that rock. He crep’ up jest as ef he
knowed thar was suthin’ to see below.”</p>

<p>“The skunk!”</p>

<p>“Prob’ly,” went on the sentinel, “he was put onto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
thing by them galoots,” and he pointed to Snell and his
companion.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” roared more than one, angrily.</p>

<p>“So this is what ye call bein’ on the square, is it?” exclaimed
the chief, turning to Snell’s companion, fiercely.
“Ye make a deal to meet us here alone to talk business,
and give the tip to a pryin’ detective, do ye? An’ do ye
think ye’ll git outen it with hull skins? Wal, I don’t
think!”</p>

<p>The ruffians were growling angrily and watching their
leader.</p>

<p>It needed only his word to make every one of them
empty their revolvers into Snell and his companion.</p>

<p>Snell was horribly frightened.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about this,” he stammered; “I
give you my word of honor——”</p>

<p>“Rats!” interrupted the leader, scornfully, “what’s your
word of honor worth?”</p>

<p>“Plug ’em full of holes!” cried another.</p>

<p>The men raised their weapons, and it did look as if
there would be a double murder on the spot.</p>

<p>“He’s right!” said Patsy, quietly.</p>

<p>The leader turned swiftly toward him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that ye say?” he demanded; “who’s right?”</p>

<p>“The man who just spoke.”</p>

<p>“Him?” pointing to Snell.</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t know who he is.”</p>

<p>“And I s’pose ye don’t know him, nuther,” pointing to
Snell’s companion.</p>

<p>“I certainly don’t.”</p>

<p>It was plain enough that nobody believed the detective,
but he breathed easier.</p>

<p>His interruption had gained time.</p>

<p>The men were not so likely now to shoot in a hurry and
ask questions afterward.</p>

<p>Patsy had been set on the ground with his back to a
rock.</p>

<p>Snell’s companion was looking at him sharply.</p>

<p>It was to him the leader spoke next.</p>

<p>“I s’pose, Jim Leonard,” he said, “thet you’ve got a
word of honor to stack up thet ye never seen this man
afore, eh?”</p>

<p>“He’s a stranger to me,” replied Leonard. “I never saw
him before, and we took all the pains we could to keep
from being followed. Snell’s been in town three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
without seeing anybody who was on his track. Why
should anybody be on his track, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Why!” roared the leader, “to get us behind the bars,
you fool! Ain’t that reason enough?”</p>

<p>He turned again to the detective.</p>

<p>“P’r’haps you’ll tell us how ye come here?” he said.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Patsy. “I saw these two men in
town. It was plain enough that they had good business
of some kind on. I took ’em for prospectors and thought
they’d struck a good thing somewhere. It wasn’t a
straight thing to do, but I followed ’em to see what they’d
got.”</p>

<p>This was a story that it was very easy for the rough
Westerners to believe.</p>

<p>Evidently they were struck by it, for they looked at
each other doubtfully.</p>

<p>All except the leader.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes from Snell to his companion, and
then to Patsy, and remarked, calmly:</p>

<p>“You lie—every one of ye.”</p>

<p>Then he addressed his men.</p>

<p>“We won’t go off at half-cock,” said he; “these geezers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
hev done us dirt, but mebbe we’d better talk it over
afore we do anything.”</p>

<p>He spoke then to the sentinels.</p>

<p>“Stay here and use yer guns, ef any of ’em tries to
scoot. We’ll go further down the gulch and chin about
it.”</p>

<p>The sentinels nodded and the leader and the rest of his
men went down the ravine until they were out of sight.</p>

<p>Now and then their voices could be heard as they
argued, but what they said could not be told.</p>

<p>Once they sent a couple of men up to take Snell’s companion,
Jim Leonard, down to talk with him.</p>

<p>They sent him back after half an hour, and continued
their discussion until the sun was setting.</p>

<p>Then they all came slowly back to the spot where Patsy
lay.</p>

<p>The young man who had been speaking when Patsy
was captured, was talking with the leader.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’s the best way,” he was saying.</p>

<p>“Wal, Harry,” returned the leader, “you’ve got a
sound nut on yer shoulders, an’ you can talk better’n
most of us, but I dunno. Howsomever, we’ll try it. As
you say, the main thing is to get the stuff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“We certainly can’t get the ransom, if we don’t give
’em a chance to pay it,” said Harry.</p>

<p>The leader nodded.</p>

<p>“After dark,” he said, shortly.</p>

<p>It grew dark early in that deep ravine, but it was not
till fully two hours had passed that the gang began to
move.</p>

<p>In the meantime, they smoked and talked in low voices,
or lay on the ground and snoozed.</p>

<p>At last the leader stood up and said:</p>

<p>“Bring ’em along.”</p>

<p>Patsy had tried at first to see if he could free his hands.
In the darkness he tried again, but it was of no use.</p>

<p>These fellows had known how to tie a knot, and they
kept the noose around his neck, with a warning that they
wouldn’t mind leaving him there for crows to pick.</p>

<p>That was only too plain. They cared little for the detective.
It was Snell and Leonard that they were interested
in.</p>

<p>The gang returned to Helena in pairs mostly.</p>

<p>Two went beside Patsy, and one each with Snell and
Leonard.</p>

<p>The rest trailed along—some in advance, some behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>When they came to the edge of the town they scattered
over different streets.</p>

<p>No one meeting any of them would have suspected that
a score of men were coming into the city together.</p>

<p>Patsy’s guides took the noose from around his neck
then, and cautioned him that if he tried to break away
they would shoot.</p>

<p>The caution wasn’t necessary, for the detective had no
idea of doing anything except stick to the gang until he
had found out all about the business that had brought
them together.</p>

<p>They came at length to a house in a quiet street.</p>

<p>Patsy’s guides took him in there, opening the front
door with a key, and led him to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The house was dark when they arrived, but it had gas,
and this was lit.</p>

<p>Curtains were pulled down at the windows, and they
waited in silence.</p>

<p>Others came in from time to time.</p>

<p>The last to arrive were Snell and Leonard, and the
men who had been walking with them.</p>

<p>It was understood that they had been to Bronco Bill’s,
where Snell had hidden the “stuff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>When all were there, the leader said:</p>

<p>“Now, ef ye’re ready fer business at last, let’s git at it
without any palaver.”</p>

<p>“We’re ready,” responded Leonard.</p>

<p>“Prove it.”</p>

<p>Leonard glanced at Snell, who slowly drew a wallet
from his pocket, and took from it a number of one-thousand-dollar
bills.</p>

<p>The eyes of the men in the gang flashed greedily.</p>

<p>“I’d ruther ’twas gold,” muttered the leader, “but it
looks straight enough.”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly straight,” said Snell, closing the wallet.</p>

<p>“Wal, but what are ye doin’ now? You brought that
stuff to hand over, didn’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; when you deliver the goods.”</p>

<p>It was Snell who responded, and his voice was calm
now.</p>

<p>He seemed to feel that his victory was won.</p>

<p>Leonard, on the other hand, looked worried.</p>

<p>“Guess that’s right enough, then,” remarked the leader.
“We’ve got the goods, an’ we’ll show thet we can meet ye.
Harry——”</p>

<p>He interrupted himself suddenly, with a glance at Patsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Twon’t do,” he added, in a decided tone; “not jest
yet. We don’t want no witnesses to this perceedin’. I
don’t perfess to say thet this geezer’s a detective, but dead
men tell no tales. I wisht we’d bored holes in him out
thar in the hills.”</p>

<p>“Better not do any shootin’ here,” suggested one of the
men.</p>

<p>“Right; but thar’s a good way, jest as quiet an’ peaceable
as a graveyard. Take him into the basement.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Harry, “you wouldn’t do that?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t I? In course I would,” replied the leader,
harshly. “You go an’ git the goods, Harry, an’ mind yer
own business. Two or three of ye gag that geezer and
tie his feet. Then take him to the basement. Hear?”</p>

<p>They heard.</p>

<p>Patsy saw young Harry’s face pale as he went slowly
from the room.</p>

<p>Others proceeded promptly to obey the leader.</p>

<p>“I wonder if my time has really come at last?” thought
the detective.</p>

<p>He could make no resistance, and tried none.</p>

<p>It was useless, too, to bluff the men or try to plead with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>They stuffed his own handkerchief in his mouth and
tied a cord tightly around his ankles.</p>

<p>Then they lifted him, while the rest of the gang and
Snell and Leonard looked silently on, and took him from
the room by a door that opened upon a stairway.</p>

<p>Down the stairs and along a short passage they carried
the helpless detective, and at last laid him upon a cemented
floor.</p>

<p>Not a ray of light was there.</p>

<p>The men stumbled in the darkness as if they were not
familiar with the place.</p>

<p>“Say yer pra’rs, tenderfoot,” remarked one of them,
with a harsh chuckle, as he started away.</p>

<p>“He’s got nerve,” said another, noticing that no sound
came from their victim’s throat.</p>

<p>“More likely he’s scared silly,” returned the first.</p>

<p>One of them was feeling along the wall.</p>

<p>“Hurry up,” said the other.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, I’ve found it,” was the reply from a
corner.</p>

<p>“Full on,” said the first.</p>

<p>“So ’tis.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>They went out.</p>

<p>Patsy heard the door close behind them.</p>

<p>Then their steps stumbling along the passage and upstairs.</p>

<p>At last he heard the opening and shutting of a door at
the top.</p>

<p>The sound of the leader’s rough voice came to him, evidently
asking a question.</p>

<p>“Is the trick done?” or something of that sort.</p>

<p>He could imagine the men’s short answer.</p>

<p>Then probably the gang got down to business again with
Snell and Leonard.</p>

<p>It would do no good to try to tell what Patsy’s thoughts
and feelings were.</p>

<p>He had been unlucky enough before to get captured
by men who meant to kill him.</p>

<p>On other occasions he had worked himself free, or
Nick or Chick had come just in time to rescue him.</p>

<p>Nick was thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>Chick wasn’t on this strange case at all.</p>

<p>The cords upon his hands and legs were very firm.</p>

<p>And yet the young man felt no despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Somehow!” he thought, and he went to rubbing his
back as well as he could against the hard cellar floor.</p>

<p>He thought he might wear the cords through in time.</p>

<p>In time—good Heaven! would there be time?</p>

<p>What was that he smelled?</p>

<p>An enemy more fearful than the bullets of assassins.</p>

<p>He understood now what he had been doing when the
man had been feeling along the way.</p>

<p>The villain had been hunting for the gas jet.</p>

<p>He had found it and turned the cock “full on!”</p>

<p>The close cellar was filling rapidly with the poisonous
stuff.</p>

<p>Patsy’s throat tickled.</p>

<p>He coughed and partly dislodged his gag, but it was
only to take more gas into his lungs.</p>

<p>With all his might he wriggled so that the cord might
be cut or worn enough to break.</p>

<p>He could make no effect on it, so far as he could tell.</p>

<p>Every strain simply made the cord cut deeper into his
flesh, and he was as helpless as before.</p>

<p>The poisoned atmosphere choked him.</p>

<p>He felt his head whirling.</p>

<p>The whole house seemed to be going around and around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>In the confusion of his mind he seemed to hear voices
in a loud discussion.</p>

<p>They ceased—there was no sound—except a fearful
roaring as if he lay at the bottom of Niagara Falls.</p>

<p>And then, a dreadful feeling that he might as well give
it all up.</p>

<p>A man had to die some time.</p>

<p>One time was probably as good as another.</p>

<p>He had done what Nick told him to as well as he knew
how.</p>

<p>He hoped that Nick and Chick would somehow get at
this gang.</p>

<p>Patsy was very tired and sleepy.</p>

<p>The whirling and the noises ceased. His brain was at
rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.
<br />
<small>THE MYSTERY OF GEORGE SNELL.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter had said good-by to his bright young assistant
at about half-past ten of an evening.</p>

<p>He gave little further thought to the case that night, for
he knew that it was in good hands.</p>

<p>“I shall probably hear from the boy in the morning,”
he thought, as he went to bed.</p>

<p>No message came from Patsy in the morning, because
the young man had been too much occupied in watching
Snell and Leonard in the Jersey City station to send one.</p>

<p>But a message came from Dinsmore that gave Nick a
bit of a surprise.</p>

<p>It was as follows:</p>

<p>“Important robbery just reported. Don’t know if it is
the one you referred to last night, but it is very important
and mysterious. Wish you would come on.”</p>

<p>Nick took the next train for the West.</p>

<p>Dinsmore’s telegram was sent from Manchester, the
capital of Wenonah, and there, of course, the detective
went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The journey was without incident, and was made as
rapidly as possible, considering that there are no through
trains between New York and the distant Canadian town.</p>

<p>Dinsmore met him at the station.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a telegram for you,” he said, as soon as they
had shaken hands. “It was forwarded from New York,
after you left.”</p>

<p>Nick opened and read it. It was the one Patsy had
sent from Chicago to say that he was going with Snell to
Helena.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Nick. “Now, what’s the case?”</p>

<p>“It was reported by the lieutenant governor,” replied
Dinsmore, “Gov. Bradley being away. His absence makes
the thing very peculiar, and I don’t understand it at all.
How you should know in New York that a robbery had
taken place in Manchester before anybody here suspected
such a thing, is quite a mystery.”</p>

<p>“I believe,” responded Nick, “that I begin to see how
that happened. But go on. Some State papers have disappeared.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, and that’s what makes me suppose it the
same affair that you seemed to have in mind when you
telegraphed from New York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean anything else stolen? Not that I am
aware of, but the papers are very important. I thought
you ought to come on, as you seemed to know something
of the matter.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I don’t, but I’m interested. You say
there’s been no abduction, or kidnaping?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so, but I know of no such case.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell me all you know about the loss of the
papers.”</p>

<p>“That’s very little. The lieutenant governor called me
up late on the night you telegraphed me. In fact, I think
it was about two hours after I had sent my answer.</p>

<p>“‘Dinsmore,’ said he, ‘there’s been a very strange robbery,
or something that looks very much like it. Some
papers that cannot be of value to ordinary thieves, but for
which the government would pay a handsome reward,
have disappeared.’”</p>

<p>“I asked him when they were taken.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve no idea,’ he answered. ‘I only discovered the loss
this afternoon.’</p>

<p>“Then I asked him why he had not called on me sooner.</p>

<p>“‘Because,’ he replied, ‘we’ve been hunting high and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
low for the papers. We supposed they must be somewhere
in the government building. But we’ve looked
everywhere. They’re gone, and that’s all there is to it.’”</p>

<p>“I thought of your telegram, Nick, but said nothing.
After I had asked the usual questions about where the
papers were kept, and so forth, I inquired if he had any
suspicions.</p>

<p>“The questions seemed to make him uneasy.</p>

<p>“‘I cannot suspect anybody,’ he replied.</p>

<p>“I remembered you, Nick, and I said:</p>

<p>“‘That means that you suspect everybody.’”</p>

<p>“What did he say to that?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Huh! he smiled in a queer way, and simply said:
‘Well?’ Of course, I pressed him to be frank with me,
but didn’t succeed at first.</p>

<p>“Finally, though, he let the cat out of the bag in a kind
of roundabout way.</p>

<p>“I saw that he actually suspected Gov. Bradley himself.”</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed Nick, “that’s rather interesting.”</p>

<p>“Yes—and mysterious. I’ll tell you a fact or two without
stopping to say how I squeezed them from the lieutenant
governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some six or seven weeks ago a man unknown here
called on Gov. Bradley. We know his name was Leonard
and that he and the governor had been in some sort of
business deal together years before.</p>

<p>“That much is known, because a part of their conversation
was accidentally overheard.</p>

<p>“Nobody thought anything of it at the time, of course,
for it all seemed natural and straight enough.</p>

<p>“The lieutenant governor heard Leonard asking about
some papers of some kind.</p>

<p>“‘They’re safe,’ Gov. Bradley told him.</p>

<p>“‘That’s all well enough for you to say,’ Leonard responded,
‘but I’d rather keep them myself. Then I’d
know.’”</p>

<p>Dinsmore paused.</p>

<p>“Does anybody know what the governor said to that?”
asked Nick.</p>

<p>“He was heard to say something to the effect that that
would give Leonard the whip hand.</p>

<p>“The men were evidently on bad terms, and that is all
that is known of that matter.</p>

<p>“Now, some time later—it is rather more than three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
weeks ago—Gov. Bradley left town. He hasn’t been back
since.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything strange in that?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. He went away openly enough. Told
everybody that he was tired and needed rest. That was
natural. He also told the lieutenant governor secretly
that he was going to travel without letting anybody know
where he was.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t want to be bothered with letters,’ he said.”</p>

<p>“That was natural enough, too, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so; but just now the lieutenant governor is
putting two and two together, and I can see that he is
suspicious. He hasn’t said so in so many words, you understand,
but that’s what he feels, just the same.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me all, Dinsmore.”</p>

<p>“Not quite. Governor Bradley told the lieutenant governor
that he would manage to be within reach at all
times, but that his movements and address must be kept
private.</p>

<p>“‘I will take the name of George Snell,’ said he, ‘and
keep you informed where you may telegraph to me, if anything
of real importance comes up.’</p>

<p>“So, for some days, the lieutenant governor received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
telegram every day, saying: ‘Snell, Auditorium, Chicago,’
or ‘Snell, Planter’s, St. Louis,’ and so forth.</p>

<p>“Then there was a break of a few days, after which
came word that ‘Snell’ was at the Fifth Avenue Hotel,
New York.</p>

<p>“Meantime, nothing had happened that the lieutenant
governor couldn’t attend to alone.</p>

<p>“Then came the discovery that papers were missing.</p>

<p>“As soon as it was certain that the papers had disappeared,
the lieutenant governor telegraphed the fact to
‘Snell,’ and told him in the same message that the matter
would be placed in my hands.</p>

<p>“If the lieutenant governor had thought twice, he would
have called me up before wiring to Bradley, alias Snell,
but he didn’t think quick enough, and since that time not
a word has been heard from ‘Snell.’ And there you are.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Nick; “it’s very interesting. When does
the next train go to Helena, Mont.?”</p>

<p>“To Helena! There’s no direct train to that point, in
any case; but what the mischief do you want to go there
for?”</p>

<p>“Because that’s where Gov. Bradley is, or where he
went. I think, Dinsmore, that I shall have to hunt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
your governor, as well as for the thieves who stole the
papers. I hope I may find the governor alive.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! what——”</p>

<p>“Look up the trains, please. I want to catch the first
that goes.”</p>

<p>With a wondering face, Dinsmore studied a railway
guide for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Presently, he looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“There’s a train in half an hour,” he said, “that will get
you pretty well started, and you can probably make connections
that will take you through so as to reach Helena
in about thirty hours. Will that do?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell? I must take that train, and I think,
Dinsmore, it would be as well if you should come along,
too.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, gladly.”</p>

<p>“Anything to do to get ready?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Let’s start for the station, then.”</p>

<p>They went out, and on the way Nick asked:</p>

<p>“Dinsmore, do you know anybody in Manchester whose
name is Cecil West?”</p>

<p>“Slightly,” replied Dinsmore. “Friend of yours?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I never saw him. What sort of a man is he?”</p>

<p>“Tiptop, from all I hear. Not rich, you know, but
honest and industrious. First-rate fellow, every way. By
the way, he’s in love with the governor’s daughter, Estelle.”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the old man won’t have him. He’s sent the
girl away, so as to keep them from meeting.”</p>

<p>“The governor sent his daughter away, did he?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I hear. She dropped out of sight after a
big party at the governor’s house some five weeks ago,
and it is understood that she was packed off to visit a
distant aunt, or something, in the hope that she would forget
young West.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if West hears from her?” mused Nick.</p>

<p>“If he does, he doesn’t say so.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>Nothing more was said on this subject, and Dinsmore
did not suspect what was in the detective’s mind.</p>

<p>Nick asked one other question about the case:</p>

<p>“I understand that nothing has been reported, except a
theft of government papers. Is that right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and I have wondered a little, for in your telegram
to me you mentioned jewelry.”</p>

<p>“I did. I heard some was taken.”</p>

<p>“Nick,” said Dinsmore, “who gave you the tip about all
this?”</p>

<p>The detective looked his old friend in the eyes for a
moment, and answered, quietly:</p>

<p>“Gov. Bradley.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you say! Why didn’t you jump on the
case?”</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t know till I arrived in Manchester that
it was the governor who called on me. He said his name
was Snell. I doubted it, but I had no suspicion as to
who he really was. I could see that he was holding
some facts back, and that made me turn him down. That
was where Bradley made a bad mistake.”</p>

<p>The detective and Dinsmore made good connections,
and arrived in Helena at six o’clock in the evening of
the following day.</p>

<p>They began at once to trace the men they wanted to find.</p>

<p>Dinsmore made inquiries for a man answering the description
of Gov. Bradley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick, knowing that Patsy must have come to Helena,
hunted for some trace of him.</p>

<p>He had the more difficult task, for Patsy, of course, had
been disguised when he arrived in the town, and, as Nick
presumed, he changed his disguise almost daily.</p>

<p>Calculating from the telegram, Nick reckoned that
Patsy must have reached Helena on a certain day and by
a certain train.</p>

<p>He asked men employed at the station about the passengers
who arrived on that day.</p>

<p>From one he got a tip as to a man who might be Patsy
who left his grip at the station and walked away.</p>

<p>The grip was sent for later, the man said, and was
taken to a street that he named.</p>

<p>Nick went to that street.</p>

<p>He walked the length of it twice.</p>

<p>There was no good hotel on it, but several boarding
houses, and any number of saloons.</p>

<p>Among others was Bronco Bill’s.</p>

<p>Nick looked at it each time he passed.</p>

<p>It was not the first one he entered, but, after dropping
in at two or three other places, he entered Bronco Bill’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
place just as the proprietor was telling a customer about
a shooting scrap that had taken place there recently.</p>

<p>“They wanted to make the tenderfoot dance,” said Bill,
grinning, “but durn me ef he didn’t make them dance
and holler afore he got through with them. Such shootin’
I never did see! I thought ’twould be the last of
Bronco Bill’s house, but the young stranger just brought
them crazy galoots to their senses in no time. Say! he
hit a dime——”</p>

<p>And Bill went on to tell the whole story.</p>

<p>“Patsy!” said Nick to himself, as he slowly put down
a glass of beer at the other end of the bar. “I wonder
how long it will take Dinsmore to follow his trail to this
joint?”</p>

<p>Nick sat down to wait, and had supper meantime.</p>

<p>Shortly after nine o’clock, Dinsmore came in, looking
sour and hopeless.</p>

<p>“Ah! there you are,” said he. “I’ve been looking for
you.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come here, then?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t expect to find you here. I seemed
to trace a man who looked like the governor to this hole
several times. Plenty said they’d seen such a man hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
around, but the governor wouldn’t put up in such a place,
not he!”</p>

<p>“It’s where he put up, just the same,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Who told you?”</p>

<p>“I guessed it. My assistant has been here, and he
wouldn’t stay in such a place, either, unless there was
business in it. The business that brought Patsy here
was——”</p>

<p>Nick did not finish.</p>

<p>Instead, he caught up a newspaper and held it in front
of Dinsmore.</p>

<p>“Read it!” he whispered, “and don’t show your face!”</p>

<p>Four men were coming in from the street.</p>

<p>One of them was the man whom Nick had known as
George Snell.</p>

<p>As the detective was now disguised, he did not hesitate
to show his face.</p>

<p>It looked, however, as if his disguise would have been
unnecessary, for Snell walked quickly across the room
and out by a door at the back.</p>

<p>One of the four went with him.</p>

<p>The other two stepped up to the bar and called for
drinks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Snell came back in a short time with the man who had
gone out with him.</p>

<p>“Have something?” asked a man at the bar.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Snell; “let’s be going.”</p>

<p>The four then went out at once.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” whispered Dinsmore, “that was Gov.
Bradley’s voice!”</p>

<p>“Of course it was,” replied Nick. “Come on.”</p>

<p>They kept on the track of the four men, and followed
them to a house in a quiet street.</p>

<p>There was a light in the kitchen windows.</p>

<p>“Crooked work here,” whispered Dinsmore.</p>

<p>“Sure!” replied Nick. “We must get a line on it, if
possible.”</p>

<p>They had not gone very near the house, presuming that
there might be men on guard who would give warning
to the others.</p>

<p>It seemed best to try to get at the kitchen windows from
behind, and, accordingly, they went around to another
street, through a yard, and over a fence.</p>

<p>This took some time, but the lights were still there, and
all was quiet within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the curtains were down, they managed to get
a glimpse inside through a small hole.</p>

<p>It was just enough to show a good many tough-looking
men around a table, with Snell in the middle.</p>

<p>He was counting out a big roll of bills.</p>

<p>“Buying back the papers,” whispered Nick, “and paying
the ransom for his daughter.”</p>

<p>“What! you don’t mean——”</p>

<p>“Miss Bradley was kidnaped. That’s what I mean.
Ah! if the governor had had the sense to tell me the whole
truth!”</p>

<p>Nick was thinking.</p>

<p>“There are a good many of them,” whispered Dinsmore;
“shall we go to headquarters for a squad of
police?”</p>

<p>“No. They’ll be through in a minute. We must make
a bluff, and they’ll think they’re surrounded. You go to
the front door, and I’ll tackle them here.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
<small>THE RANSOM.</small></h2>


<p>Harry had brought down what the leader of the gang
called “the goods.”</p>

<p>This was a parcel of papers done up in red tape.</p>

<p>It was laid on the kitchen table, and Snell began to
count out the money that he had shown a few minutes before.</p>

<p>“I have forty thousand dollars here,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Ought to be twice that!” growled the leader.</p>

<p>“That was the price agreed on with Leonard, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t produced the goods.”</p>

<p>Snell, or, rather, Gov. Bradley, stopped counting out the
money, and looked straight at the leader.</p>

<p>“Plank down the money!” ordered the leader, harshly.</p>

<p>Just then there was a furious knocking at both the back
and front doors.</p>

<p>Loud voices—there seemed to be a dozen of them—were
crying:</p>

<p>“Surrender, in the name of the law!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’re done!” gasped the leader, starting up, and lifting
his revolver, “and by thunder! I know who done it!
You, Harry, you sneak, with your argument——”</p>

<p>“I haven’t given you away, Hamilton,” cried Harry,
“I swear——”</p>

<p>He got no further, for Hamilton, the leader, fired.</p>

<p>Harry groaned and staggered to the cellar door.</p>

<p>He grasped the handle to keep from falling.</p>

<p>It turned, the door opened, and he plunged headlong
down the stairs.</p>

<p>All the other men were starting up in great confusion.</p>

<p>“Kill the governor!” they cried.</p>

<p>“No!” shouted Hamilton; “there’ll be more in him than
in anything else. Take him with us.”</p>

<p>Then he added, in a lower tone:</p>

<p>“Side door, boys. Nobody seems to be there. They’ve
forgotten the side door!”</p>

<p>He seized the governor as he spoke, and pushed him
from the room.</p>

<p>Others helped, and both the governor and Leonard were
hustled out.</p>

<p>All the things on the table—money and papers—were
swept off by somebody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>A door crashed in, and next instant Nick Carter leaped
into the room.</p>

<p>He was greeted by a pistol shot from one of the ruffians.</p>

<p>It missed him.</p>

<p>Many voices were heard, calling, ordering, cursing.</p>

<p>Dinsmore rushed in from the front.</p>

<p>“Heaven!” he gasped, “the governor’s voice. He’s calling
for help. After him, Nick, and rescue him.”</p>

<p>Together they made for the side door.</p>

<p>They overtook some of the gang there and Nick laid
them flat with giant blows from his fists.</p>

<p>Then they went on.</p>

<p>Over a fence at a little distance a number of men were
seen climbing.</p>

<p>A pistol shot from Nick dropped one.</p>

<p>The rest ran on.</p>

<p>Nick and Dinsmore dashed off in pursuit, their one
hope being to rescue the governor, who had foolishly tried
to do his own detective work.</p>

<p class="asterism">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Patsy felt as if a fearfully heavy blanket lay upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly, for he was less than half-awake, he put up his
hands to brush the blanket away.</p>

<p>It was too heavy, and he wondered.</p>

<p>Then he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>It was rather a dark place, and rough, unfinished ceiling
overhead.</p>

<p>He saw that first, naturally, for he was lying on his
back.</p>

<p>“By Jumbo!” he muttered, beginning to remember, “I
thought I was dead.”</p>

<p>He looked down, raising his head a little, and saw with
horror that what he thought was a heavy blanket was the
body of a young man.</p>

<p>There was an open knife in the young man’s hand.</p>

<p>“It’s the fellow they called Harry!” said Patsy to himself,
sitting up now and carefully lifting the body away.
“What the mischief does it all mean?”</p>

<p>His memory was returning fast.</p>

<p>He recalled now how he had been carried down to this
cellar to be suffocated with gas.</p>

<p>That was early last night.</p>

<p>It was now day, as he could tell from the light at one
dusty window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides, the cellar door was open, the one opening into
the passage through which he had been taken.</p>

<p>His hands had been bound so hard that he could not
loose them, and now they were free!</p>

<p>“How did that hap——”</p>

<p>He looked at the cord that had been around his wrists.</p>

<p>It was cut through.</p>

<p>Nothing could be clearer than that smooth mark of a
sharp knife.</p>

<p>The detective looked at the knife in Harry’s dead hand.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” he said, softly. “The poor fellow tried to
save me, and he came pretty near doing it.”</p>

<p>He tried to take the knife from Harry’s hand, but the
stiffened fingers held it tight.</p>

<p>His own knife was in his pocket, and with that he cut
the cord around his ankles.</p>

<p>Then he got up.</p>

<p>His head still swam, and he was weak, but his strength
came back rapidly.</p>

<p>Going to the wall, he found the gas jet.</p>

<p>The cock had been turned square off.</p>

<p>“Harry did it,” he whispered. “Poor fellow! I remember
how he couldn’t stand the idea of my being murdered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
His coming in and leaving the door open, ventilated
the place, and so I didn’t die of suffocation. Poor
chap! he meant well. I wonder how he came to be shot?”</p>

<p>Shot he was, as the detective could see from the wound
in the young man’s breast.</p>

<p>Patsy stood still for a full minute.</p>

<p>“Hang me!” he exclaimed, “if it doesn’t seem as wonderful
as if I was dead!”</p>

<p>He felt for his revolver.</p>

<p>One had been taken away from him, but he had the
other, and, with this in his hand, he went upstairs.</p>

<p>The house was very still.</p>

<p>In the kitchen he found overturned chairs and other
signs of disorder.</p>

<p>“There was a ruction of some kind,” he concluded.</p>

<p>He wasn’t sure just what he ought to do, and decided
that before he tried to form a plan he would explore the
house.</p>

<p>Nothing attracted his attention in the rooms of the
ground floor, and it was the same on the next floor.</p>

<p>They were ordinary rooms, furnished cheaply.</p>

<p>The detective looked into bureau drawers, not because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he was expecting to find anything, but to see if there was
any evidence that the house was regularly occupied.</p>

<p>There was none. All the drawers were empty.</p>

<p>Opening a door, he found himself at the foot of the
stairs to the attic.</p>

<p>“Might as well take it all in,” he thought, and he
started up.</p>

<p>The third step was loose, and came up when he put his
foot on it.</p>

<p>At once he pulled the board away.</p>

<p>He saw something that made his eyes bulge.</p>

<p>A box had been made beneath the step, and, lying in it,
were two packets of papers done up in red ribbon, and a
great quantity of money in big bills.</p>

<p>He took out and counted twenty one-thousand-dollar
bills, and twenty thousand more dollars in bills of five and
one hundred.</p>

<p>“Whew!” he whistled, sitting down and looking at his
find.</p>

<p>A sound startled him.</p>

<p>It came from above.</p>

<p>A faint, weak voice—a woman’s, apparently.</p>

<p>It seemed to be calling for help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Patsy stuffed the money in his pockets, and bounded up
the attic stairs.</p>

<p>Under the unfinished loft on a couch of blankets he saw
a young woman lying.</p>

<p>She was tied to the place so that she could turn over only
with difficulty.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” he cried, “who are you? What does
this mean? Have you been hurt?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, weakly, “but I am so weak and
hungry. They haven’t given me anything to eat or
drink for more than a day. I suppose they have forgotten
me. I am Estelle Bradley, sir. If you would only get
word to my father! He is the Governor of Wenonah, and
I know he would reward you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to talk, Miss Bradley,” interrupted Patsy.</p>

<p>He was stooping to cut the cords that bound her to the
floor.</p>

<p>When this was done, he helped her to her feet and then
downstairs. On the way, he took the papers he had seen
in the box, and put them in his pockets.</p>

<p>She told him, when he explained that he was a detective,
how she had been deceived by a message that was
supposed to be sent by her lover, Cecil West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was handed to me during a party at my father’s
house,” she said, “and it told me that Cecil was lying
dangerously wounded not far away. I went at once to see
him, and was seized by rough men, who brought me here
and have kept me ever since.”</p>

<p>Patsy took her to a hotel, where they had breakfast.</p>

<p>Then, knowing nothing of Nick’s journey to the West,
he arranged for taking her home.</p>

<p>They started on a train that left Helena just as Nick
and Dinsmore returned after a successful chase of the
ruffians.</p>

<p>It had taken them most of the night, but they had rescued
the governor and caught three of the gang, though
Hamilton, the leader, had escaped.</p>

<p>Leonard had been shot through the heart by the leader
when it came to the last fight out in the hills miles beyond
Helena.</p>

<p>The governor confessed bitterly that he and Leonard
had been engaged in a business that could not be called
quite square years before.</p>

<p>“For my reputation,” said the governor, “I had to keep
certain papers, and Leonard wanted them, fearing that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
would give them up some time, and so ruin him. We
feared each other.</p>

<p>“So he hired a band of ruffians to steal the papers. They
not only stole mine, but, without knowing it, a number of
government documents, also. Then, to make a complete
job of it, they kidnaped my daughter.</p>

<p>“I dared not trust my secrets to the police, or to you,
Mr. Carter. When Leonard found that the ruffians would
not give up the papers without an immense ransom, that
he was unable to pay, he told me what he had done. It
was for the interest of both of us to keep the matter dark,
and he thought he could drive a bargain with the thieves.</p>

<p>“So I got together all the cash I could and we tried it.</p>

<p>“We went from city to city, but whether Leonard saw
the leader anywhere, I do not know. At last, I told him
I should give the matter to Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“Leonard threatened to kill me if I did so. He nearly
succeeded, as, perhaps, you know. At last, he said we
should find that gang in Helena, and that by this time
they would be willing to come to my terms—forty thousand
dollars—their first bid having been for a hundred
thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“We came to Helena, Leonard taking a different route
from Chicago, in order to give the word to the gang, who,
he said, were mostly at the North.</p>

<p>“I came here and went, as he told me, to a low saloon,
where I stayed till he came, and the rest you know.”</p>

<p>“Not quite all,” said Nick; “wasn’t there a man on your
track all this time?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of, though yesterday a stranger was
found spying on us. The gang killed him.”</p>

<p>“How? When? Where?” demanded Nick, anxiously.</p>

<p>Gov. Bradley told him about the way the stranger was
put down the cellar.</p>

<p>“And I was there,” thought Nick, with deep sorrow,
“perhaps in time to save him! I wish I had let the governor
go.”</p>

<p>They went to the house, and found it deserted by all,
save the dead Harry.</p>

<p>What Nick saw, though, the open knife, the cut cords,
convinced him that Patsy had made his escape.</p>

<p>But the case did not seem to be finished, for the valuable
papers and the governor’s daughter were still missing, to
say nothing of the great ransom that had been paid down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>So Nick went with the governor to Manchester, and
there found Patsy, Miss Estelle, and all that the governor
had been looking for.</p>

<p>It is supposed that one of the gang hid the papers and
the money in the box under the stairs during the confusion
of the attempt to escape.</p>

<p>“It was a clever move,” said Nick, discussing it; “for
the rascal must have known that some, if not all the gang,
would be captured, and it would be foolish to have the
stuff captured with them. So he took the chance of hiding
it, meaning to go back some time, next day, probably, and
get it.”</p>

<p>Gov. Bradley offered to pay Nick and Patsy for their
services.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we want any pay,” replied Nick. “We’ve
had a good time out of it, and we weren’t engaged on the
matter at all. But I’d like to ask two favors.”</p>

<p>“They shall be granted,” said the governor.</p>

<p>“First, then, when you have detective work to do in the
future, don’t try to do it yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” laughed the governor; “you may be sure
I shan’t try that sort of thing again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“The second,” said Nick, “is that you consent to the
marriage of your daughter and Cecil West. He’s a fine
young man——”</p>

<p>“I yield,” interrupted Gov. Bradley. “I will send for
West at once.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.
<br />
<small>A CALL TO COLORADO.</small></h2>


<p>“Patsy, here’s a letter from a friend of mine in Colorado
who asks me to go around that way and look at
some mining property he’s got.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing,” said Patsy. “I’m pretty sick of British
America, and I guess Colorado is about as good a way
as any other to get back to old New York. I don’t suppose
we’ll ever strike that gang of villains again.”</p>

<p>“You think not?” queried Nick. “I’m not usually disposed
to plume myself on any prophetic gifts, but something
tells me that before we sight the Brooklyn Bridge
again we’ll have some of the members of that gang to deal
with once more. In the meantime, however, we’ll accept
this invitation to Colorado.”</p>

<p>It is not necessary to dwell on the trip; suffice it to say
that Nick finished the examination of the mines and prepared
to resume his return journey.</p>

<p>While on the train he received a telegram that disarranged
his plans and gave him the first inkling that his
prophetic vision was to materialize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The telegram was from a man named Folsom, whom
Nick had met while examining his friend’s mining property.
It intimated that a tragic occurrence was disturbing
the people of Mason Creek, and that the services of
Nick Carter would be appreciated in clearing up the mystery.</p>

<p>Nick decided to reply in person to the telegram, and
started immediately for Denver.</p>

<p>It is necessary to go back a little to understand why
Folsom had telegraphed for Nick.</p>

<p>A day or two before, two men had met on a rocky
plateau, some three miles from the village of Mason Creek,
in Colorado, and a little farther from Denver, near which
city the overland express was bearing Nick Carter and his
assistant eastward.</p>

<p>One of the men was a farmer, the other a clergyman.</p>

<p>The farmer was vociferating wildly, while the clergyman
strove to pacify him.</p>

<p>“It ain’t right! it’s swindling, and you can’t make it anything
else!” declared the farmer.</p>

<p>The clergyman raised his hand, and there was a look of
pain on his pale face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t swear,” he said, gently. “Be calm,
and tell me just what you mean.”</p>

<p>The farmer looked ashamed of himself, and probably
would have answered in a quiet way if another man who
was standing near had not put in:</p>

<p>“Don’t pay any attention to him, Mr. Judson. Let him
rave. If he’s such a fool that he can’t make money, it’s
not your fault, and he has no business to complain to you.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Mr. Judson, “he makes a serious
charge——”</p>

<p>The farmer did not hear this, for he was angry almost
beyond his control, “mad clean through,” as the saying is
in that part of Colorado.</p>

<p>He did not hear, because he broke in violently:</p>

<p>“I’ve been swindled, robbed, do you hear? and you’re
just as much to blame as if you’d been the only one in the
scheme. You wear the clothes of a preacher, but, by
thunder! you’re a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and you deserve
to be shot on the spot. If you want to keep that pious
skin of yours whole, you’d better not come around Hank
Low’s way.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Low, listen to me,” the clergyman begged.</p>

<p>“Not a word, you black-coated villain! When I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the way my wife and children have been cheated by a
sneak-thief of a minister, it puts murder in my heart, it
does! I won’t talk to you, for fear I’ll forgit and take the
law into my own hands. Geddap, Jenny.”</p>

<p>The farmer’s old mare responded to the command and a
lash of the whip and jogged away, dragging the rickety
old wagon in which sat the angry Hank Low alone.</p>

<p>The clergyman turned, with a sigh, to his companion.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Mr. Claymore,” he said, “that all is not as it
should be in this matter.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” returned Claymore, easily; “you mustn’t mind
the howling of such a wild man. He doesn’t know what
he’s talking about. He won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that isn’t what I fear. I don’t like to hear a man
talk like that, because it shows that he believes he has
been wronged. There might be some truth in it. If so,
I should be the first to make it right.”</p>

<p>“But there isn’t anything wrong. It was all a plain matter
of business. Hank Low had a lot of land that he
couldn’t do anything with. We asked him his price for
it, we had a dicker with him, and he sold. What could be
simpler, or fairer, than that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of answering, the clergyman looked over the
ground where they were standing.</p>

<p>It was a level, but rocky, spot between high hills.</p>

<p>No house was in sight, but half a mile farther up the
valley was Hank Low’s cabin.</p>

<p>This spot where they stood had been part of Hank
Low’s farm.</p>

<p>He had had a hard struggle trying to make a living out
of his land, and had not succeeded very well.</p>

<p>There was a heavy mortgage to be lifted, besides.</p>

<p>One day a couple of men came to Mason Creek and
spent a good deal of time tramping about the country.</p>

<p>One of them was William Claymore.</p>

<p>After a few days of tramping about, Claymore offered
to buy the most useless part of Hank Low’s farm.</p>

<p>He mentioned the name of Rev. Elijah Judson as a
man who was interested with him in some kind of a plan.</p>

<p>Nothing very definite was said about it, but Low understood
that the clergyman meant to put up a private school
for young ladies, and wanted the land for that purpose.</p>

<p>A deal was made by which Low was able to pay off his
mortgage, but nothing more.</p>

<p>He would have been content with that if he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
discovered, when it was too late, that the parties who
bought his land had no idea of putting up a school or anything
of that sort.</p>

<p>It was at the time when the fact was just becoming
known that oil could be found in great quantities in the far
Western lands.</p>

<p>Claymore and his companion, by making secret tests of
the soil, had come to the conclusion that this worthless end
of Hank Low’s farm was the best place in the State for
oil wells.</p>

<p>So they bought several acres for next to nothing.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that their next step would be to
sink wells and build a refinery, or a pipe line.</p>

<p>But such things cost money, and neither Claymore nor
his partner had any left to speak of.</p>

<p>They had to raise it, and in this task they had the assistance
of the Rev. Elijah Judson.</p>

<p>The clergyman had not been in Colorado when Hank
Low’s land was bought.</p>

<p>In fact, he did not half understand the scheme.</p>

<p>He had not been a success as a preacher, but he had a
little money, some two or three thousand dollars, and Claymore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had persuaded him that with it he could make his
fortune in oil.</p>

<p>There was nothing dishonest in discovering oil and digging
for it.</p>

<p>If there had been, the clergyman would not have touched
the scheme.</p>

<p>Supposing that it was all right, he had put in his money,
and had been made the president of the company.</p>

<p>His name was printed in large type on the letters sent
out by Claymore.</p>

<p>These letters were sent to people in the far East, who
had been members of the Rev. Mr. Judson’s church.</p>

<p>They were sent to other places where his name was
known, and they told all about the wonderful discovery
of oil.</p>

<p>Friends of the clergyman were to be allowed to invest
in the company, if they wanted a sure thing.</p>

<p>The letters did not state that money was needed for
digging the wells or building a refinery.</p>

<p>Oh, no! Persons who received the letters were given to
understand that this was their chance to get rich quickly.</p>

<p>And the Rev. Elijah Judson’s name as president of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
oil company was enough to make everybody sure that it
was all right.</p>

<p>For, of course, the clergyman would not go into any
business that was not perfectly straight and sure.</p>

<p>That was quite the case—at least, the clergyman
thought it was. He meant well, and he really believed that
the company was square, and that there would be great
profits in the business.</p>

<p>There were many answers to the letters, and money
came in rapidly. Not many persons invested large
amounts, but the sum total was considerable.</p>

<p>All this operation of raising money for the work took
several months.</p>

<p>At last the clergyman went to Colorado to look over the
plant and do his share of the work.</p>

<p>He was surprised to find that there wasn’t any plant.</p>

<p>There was the land that had been bought; on it were a
few small mounds of loose dirt to show where borings had
been made; and in Denver there was an office of the company.</p>

<p>Nothing more.</p>

<p>Claymore explained that it took time to get the machinery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
for sinking the wells, and Mr. Judson was satisfied.</p>

<p>They went out to the land, and there happened to meet
Hank Low, as he was driving to the city with a small
load of farm stuff for the market.</p>

<p>By that time, of course, Low had learned just why his
land had been bought.</p>

<p>The farmer honestly believed that he had been swindled,
because nobody had told him that the land he was selling
was very valuable.</p>

<p>“They might have let me in on the deal,” he grumbled.
“The land was mine. S’pose it had been gold they found.
Wouldn’t it be swindling to make me sell it dirt cheap just
because I didn’t know what ’twas worth?”</p>

<p>His neighbors told him he mustn’t expect any better
treatment in a business deal.</p>

<p>“But,” he argued, “they sprung the preacher on me,
made me believe there was to be a school there. Ain’t
that false pretenses? You bet, ’tis!—an’ ef ever I git my
hands on that preacher, I’ll make him suffer!”</p>

<p>He hadn’t had his hands on the Rev. Elijah Judson, but
he had made him suffer, just the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hate to be called a swindler,” sighed the clergyman,
as he stood there with Claymore.</p>

<p>“Mr. Judson,” responded Claymore, “business is business,
and the man who gets left in a trade is always sore.
That’s all there is to it, and you mustn’t think anything
more about it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Judson, “I’ll try to think it’s all right,
but if I should find that any wrong has been done, I shall
insist on making things right with Low.”</p>

<p>There was a sneering expression on Claymore’s face, but
he said nothing, and they returned to the city.</p>

<p>Mr. Judson found new trouble there. He met one of
his old church members on the street and shook hands with
him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were in this part of the country,
Mr. Folsom,” said the clergyman.</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” snapped Mr. Folsom, in reply,
“and I presume you’d have liked it better if I had stayed
away.”</p>

<p>“Why! what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I came out here to look into the oil company I put my
money in. That’s what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Well——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“There isn’t any well. There ought to be several, but
there isn’t one, and, what’s more, there won’t be any, and
what’s more yet, you know it.”</p>

<p>“Why! Brother Folsom——”</p>

<p>“Don’t brother me! You’ve lent your name to a swindle,
and you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I can stand
my loss, and it will teach me not to trust a minister again,
but there are others, widows and orphans, who have put
their all into your infernal scheme, and they can’t stand it.
You’ve made them beggars just to fatten yourself.”</p>

<p>The clergyman grew ghastly pale as he listened, and
even Claymore, who was still with him, looked troubled.</p>

<p>“This is dreadful!” gasped Mr. Judson. “I’d die if I
believed it to be half true!”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better die,” retorted Folsom. “That’s all
I’ve got to say. I’ve looked at that wonderful land the
company bought, and there isn’t enough oil in it to fill a
lamp. Not a dollar that’s been put into it will ever be got
out again. But you’ll be fairly well off with the money
you’ve got from the widows and orphans—if you don’t get
into jail for swindling.”</p>

<p>With this Mr. Folsom strode away.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” asked Mr. Judson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sore head, that’s all,” responded Claymore. “He
doesn’t know what he’s talking about——”</p>

<p>“But he seems to. Mr. Claymore, if I find that there
has been any dishonest work in this business I shall expose
it all, understand that. I shall die of the shame of it,
but I will not commit suicide until I have seen that the
really guilty parties are punished.”</p>

<p>“Come, Mr. Judson, don’t talk of suicide. That’s foolish.
You’re not used to business, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“It is not all—ah! there’s Mr. Low’s wagon in front of
that store. I am going to speak to him.”</p>

<p>Claymore objected, but the minister was stubborn, and
they went into the store.</p>

<p>Low was there, and the clergyman asked him to call at
the hotel to talk over matters.</p>

<p>“I want to know all the facts,” said Mr. Judson.</p>

<p>“Wal,” answered Low, slowly, “I’ve got some business
to attend to, but ef ye’re in at half-past three I’ll be thar.”</p>

<p>“I shall look for you at that hour.”</p>

<p>It was then about noon, and while they were at dinner
Claymore tried to make the clergyman think that the business
was all straight, but evidently he did not succeed.</p>

<p>“I shall go to my room and think quietly till Low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
comes,” said Mr. Judson when they got up from the
table, “and I repeat that if all does not seem to be honest
and aboveboard I shall take measures to right the wrongs
that have been done.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, then,” grumbled Claymore. “I shall be at
the office if you want any information.”</p>

<p>They parted, and did not meet again.</p>

<p>Half-past three came, and, prompt to the minute, Hank
Low drove to the hotel entrance and went in.</p>

<p>Mr. Judson’s room was on the fourth floor, the clerk
told him, and called a boy to show the visitor up.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Low, “I’ve been here before, and I
know the way.”</p>

<p>He therefore went up alone.</p>

<p>Within five minutes he came down the stairs again, an
angry look upon his face.</p>

<p>He said nothing to anybody, but hastened to his wagon,
got in, said, “Geddap, Jenny,” and drove away as rapidly
as the old nag could take him.</p>

<p>As nearly as anybody could make out, it was just previous
to Low’s departure that two or three persons on a
street that ran along one side of the hotel were fearfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
startled by the sight of a man falling from an upper story
window.</p>

<p>He struck head first on the sidewalk, and was instantly
killed.</p>

<p>Men were at his side before his heart stopped beating,
but no word came from the unfortunate man’s lips.</p>

<p>He was unknown to those who saw his end, but they
knew from the cut of his clothes that he was a clergyman.</p>

<p>Information was taken to the hotel office at once, and
the clerk went out.</p>

<p>He immediately identified the body as that of a guest
of the house, the Rev. Elijah Judson.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.
<br />
<small>WAITING FOR NICK CARTER.</small></h2>


<p>In the first horror of this discovery nobody thought of
murder.</p>

<p>It was taken for granted that the unfortunate clergyman
had been leaning from his window, and lost his
balance.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before men began to look
at the thing in another way.</p>

<p>The minister’s body was left on the walk under guard
of policemen until an undertaker came to take it away.</p>

<p>Up to that time no friend of the dead man had appeared.</p>

<p>The clerk had been so shocked that he could not remember
whom he had seen with Mr. Judson.</p>

<p>So the hotel manager had engaged the undertaker.</p>

<p>At last the clerk recalled that Judson had been with
Claymore early in the morning, and that the two had dined
together in the hotel restaurant at noon.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a messenger was sent to the oil company’s
office to inform Claymore of what had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>It was while the messenger was gone on this errand
that a man went into the hotel, and laid his card on the
clerk’s desk.</p>

<p>“Send it up to Mr. Judson, please,” he said.</p>

<p>“Mr. Judson!” gasped the clerk, looking first at the man
and then at his card.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the caller, “Rev. Elijah Judson. He’s
stopping here, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes—that is, he was, Mr.——” The clerk looked at
the card. “Mr. Folsom,” he added, “but he’s—he’s
gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone! when?”</p>

<p>“A short time ago—ah! you see, Mr. Folsom, he’s
dead!”</p>

<p>“Dead!” cried Folsom, “dead! Mr. Judson dead?”</p>

<p>“Instantly killed, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Folsom echoed these words as if he were in a
dream.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he whispered then; “how did
it happen?”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows, sir,” replied the clerk, “except that he
pitched headforemost out of his window. He struck the
sidewalk; was just outside there——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The clerk’s explanation was not heard by Mr. Folsom.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens!” he gasped, pressing his hand to his
brow; “he took me in earnest and committed suicide.”</p>

<p>“Suicide!”</p>

<p>It was the clerk who repeated the word, but he had
not time to say more when Claymore rushed breathlessly
up.</p>

<p>He had caught the last of Folsom’s remark.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say of suicide?” he demanded, excitedly.</p>

<p>Folsom looked at him, blankly.</p>

<p>“I said,” he answered, slowly, “that my old friend had
committed suicide, and I fear it was some hasty, angry
words of mine that drove him to it.”</p>

<p>Claymore looked sharply at the speaker.</p>

<p>He remembered him.</p>

<p>That conversation on the street was not easy to forget,
though Claymore had taken no part in it.</p>

<p>Evidently, Folsom did not remember that he had ever
seen Claymore before.</p>

<p>He had spoken to the clergyman without noticing that
a stranger stood near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think you’re wrong,” said Claymore, still looking
straight at Folsom.</p>

<p>“I wish I could think so,” responded Folsom, sadly;
“but I spoke to Judson very harshly. I thought I had
reason to be angry, and I guess I had, but I should not
have spoken in that way. I came here just now to beg his
pardon. He said at the time he should die, and I told him
he’d better. Great Heaven! to think that I should have
hounded him to his death!”</p>

<p>Mr. Folsom was terribly distressed.</p>

<p>The crowd that had gathered at the clerk’s desk listened
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“You may be entirely right,” said Claymore, quietly,
“but I think not. I heard the conversation you refer to.”</p>

<p>“You heard it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I was with Mr. Judson at the time.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I didn’t see you. Then you heard his words?”</p>

<p>“I did, and, as I say, you may be right, but I think differently.”</p>

<p>“How can you?” asked Mr. Folsom, eagerly; “if there’s
a ray of hope for a different explanation, in the name of
Heaven speak up, man!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Judson had a bitter enemy,” said Claymore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“An enemy? Do you know this?”</p>

<p>“I heard a man threaten to kill him this morning.”</p>

<p>For an instant Mr. Folsom was too astonished to
speak.</p>

<p>He stood with his mouth open, staring at Claymore.</p>

<p>Then he brought his fist down on the clerk’s desk with
a bang, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll be responsible for tracking that enemy to
the ends of the earth, if necessary. I’ll telegraph for Nick
Carter to come. He’s in this part of the country, and I
can get him here by evening, if not sooner.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur from the crowd.</p>

<p>Everybody, unless it was Claymore, seemed to think
that this would be the best possible plan.</p>

<p>After a moment, he asked:</p>

<p>“Is Nick Carter a friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“I met him not long ago,” replied Folsom. “He’ll
come; I know he’ll come if he’s not too far away. I can’t
rest as long as there’s any shadow of doubt that I worried
poor Judson to his death.”</p>

<p>“The local police on such a plain case,” began Claymore,
but Folsom interrupted:</p>

<p>“I said I’d take the responsibility, and I will. Let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
local police do all they can. It won’t do any harm to have
Nick Carter also on the spot. I’ll wire him at once.”</p>

<p>He reached for a pad of telegraph blanks, and wrote
a dispatch, which he gave to the clerk with a request
that it be sent to the office in a hurry.</p>

<p>A bell boy went off with it on the run.</p>

<p>Then Folsom turned again to Claymore.</p>

<p>“Who is this enemy of Judson’s you speak of?” he
asked.</p>

<p>A man who had been quietly listening to the conversation
touched Claymore on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t answer that question just yet,” he said.</p>

<p>At the same time he pulled aside the lapel of his coat.</p>

<p>Claymore and Folsom both saw a badge pinned to his
vest.</p>

<p>“Come into the office a minute, both of you,” added
the stranger.</p>

<p>The two men followed him into the hotel manager’s
private room, and the door was closed.</p>

<p>“My name is Kerr,” the stranger said then. “I am a
detective, and belong to the regular force here. I shall
be very proud to work with Nick Carter on this case if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
he comes, but it is my duty to get ahead on it, and clear it
up before he arrives, if possible.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” responded Claymore.</p>

<p>Folsom nodded.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Detective Kerr, “you may answer this
gentleman’s question. Who is the enemy you refer to?”</p>

<p>“You mean the man I heard threaten Mr. Judson’s
life?” asked Claymore, cautiously.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It was a farmer named Hank Low. He lives out beyond
Mason Creek a few miles.”</p>

<p>Kerr made a note of the name.</p>

<p>“What led to the threat?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The men had high words about a business transaction,
in which Low thought he’d been badly used. As a matter
of fact, Low was treated with perfect fairness.”</p>

<p>“But he was hot about it, eh?”</p>

<p>“I should say so!”</p>

<p>“Out there.”</p>

<p>“Near Mason Creek?”</p>

<p>“Yes; on the oil company’s land.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you mean to say that this Hank Low followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Mr. Judson to the city for the purpose of murdering
him?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean to say anything of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see how we can suspect Low. Mason
Creek is some miles away——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Low was on his way to the city when we saw
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s different. Now perhaps we are getting
down to business. The first question is, did anybody see
him in town?”</p>

<p>“I saw his wagon in front of the store,” said Claymore,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Why do you hesitate?” demanded the detective
sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, just begin to feel that it’s a pretty serious thing
to bring a charge of murder against a man. You see,
Low was hot and his tongue was uncontrollable. I presume
he didn’t mean what he said.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t our business to think what he meant,” declared
Kerr. “And we’re not bringing any charge against him.
If he’s innocent he can stand a little inquiry. So you’d
better tell all you know frankly, and not wait till you are
examined in court.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be frank enough,” said Claymore, “I know
that Mr. Judson asked him to call here at half-past
three.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have said that before.”</p>

<p>Folsom, who had been listening quietly to the conversation,
here suggested that an investigation should be made
to find whether this Hank Low had been seen in the
hotel.</p>

<p>“I was just going to,” said Kerr.</p>

<p>He opened the door, and asked the clerk to step in.</p>

<p>“Do you know anybody named Low?” asked Kerr,
when the clerk was with them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the clerk; “there’s a farmer named Hank
Low, from Mason Creek——”</p>

<p>“That’s the man.”</p>

<p>The clerk said nothing further, and Kerr asked:</p>

<p>“When did you see him last?”</p>

<p>“This afternoon,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Here?”</p>

<p>“Yes—great Heaven!”</p>

<p>The clerk looked suddenly startled.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why! Hank Low called on Mr. Judson just before
he died—or was it afterward?”</p>

<p>“That’s a mighty important point,” said Kerr, gravely.
“Isn’t there any way by which you can fix the time?”</p>

<p>The clerk thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I can fix it to the minute, but I can’t
do it offhand.”</p>

<p>“Why? How can you fix it, then?”</p>

<p>“Just as Low came to the desk a telegraph boy came
with a message for a guest. I had to sign the boy’s
book.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well?”</p>

<p>“I had to enter the time, you know, and I looked up
at the clock as I did so.”</p>

<p>“Did you enter the exact minute?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“That I can’t remember.”</p>

<p>“The boy’s book will show?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Kerr, rising, “we’ll look up that boy, and
also try to find the exact minute at which Mr. Judson fell
or was thrown from the window.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective cautioned the others to say nothing
about their conversation, and went out to talk with the
men who had seen Judson fall.</p>

<p>They agreed pretty nearly as to the time of the event.</p>

<p>One said twenty-five minutes of four.</p>

<p>The other thought it was two minutes later.</p>

<p>When their watches were compared it was found that
one was two minutes ahead of the other’s.</p>

<p>The testimony of several other persons was taken on
this matter, and it was agreed that twenty-five or twenty-six
minutes of four was the time when Mr. Judson met
his death.</p>

<p>A bell boy was quietly questioned also.</p>

<p>He remembered seeing Hank Low leave the hotel office.</p>

<p>“’Twas just after he had gone up alone,” the boy said.
“I remember, ’cause the clerk was going to send me
up with him, and he saved me a trip upstairs by going
alone.”</p>

<p>This was important, and Kerr asked a number of other
questions as to how it happened that Low went up alone,
and so forth.</p>

<p>Next he found a man who remembered seeing Low
drive rapidly away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>This man did not know when he was being questioned
that Low was suspected of murder.</p>

<p>“I says, ‘Hello, Hank,’ says I,” he told the detective,
“and he said, ‘Hello,’ and got into his wagon.</p>

<p>“‘How’s things up at the farm?’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘Can’t stop to chin,’ says he, kind of mad, and he
whipped up his critter, and went away. Never seen Hank
in such a hurry.”</p>

<p>All this was important, and Kerr made a note of the
names of all witnesses.</p>

<p>“I’ll try to show Nick Carter,” he thought, “that I can
work up a case.”</p>

<p>He was just about to leave the hotel, when Folsom approached
him with a telegram in his hand.</p>

<p>He gave it to Kerr, who read the one word it contained:</p>

<p>“Coming.”</p>

<p>It was signed “N.C.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Kerr; “when he gets here I shall
probably have the guilty man in the lockup. He doesn’t
say when he will arrive.”</p>

<p>“No,” responded Folsom, “but as this was sent from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Pueblo, it shows that he is on the way. I’ve looked up
the trains, and should say that he’d be here early in the
evening.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going down to the telegraph office to look
up that messenger’s book. If it gives the time I think it
does, I shall start for Mason Creek without waiting for
Carter.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s right,” said Folsom.</p>

<p>Kerr was sure it was.</p>

<p>He went to the telegraph office, but was disappointed
to learn that the boy who had the book he needed to see
had been sent to a distant part of the city, and could not
be back before six o’clock at the earliest.</p>

<p>Then Kerr was in doubt as to what he ought to do.</p>

<p>“It would make me look like thirty cents,” he reflected,
“if I should arrest Hank Low, and bring him to the city,
only to find that the boy’s book showed that he couldn’t
have done the thing.”</p>

<p>“Suppose, for example, the book shows that the clerk
signed it at twenty minutes to four.</p>

<p>“By that time Judson had been dead at least five minutes,
and, of course, Low couldn’t be guilty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I’ll wait for the boy to get back. Carter may
be here by that time, and I’d rather take his judgment.”</p>

<p>And Kerr left it that way. He went down to the railroad
station at a quarter to six with Folsom, hoping to
meet the great detective on the train due to arrive from
Pueblo at that hour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.
<br />
<small>A SUSPECT AND AN ALIBI.</small></h2>


<p>They were not disappointed.</p>

<p>Nick was on the train, and Patsy was with him.</p>

<p>Nick greeted Folsom warmly when they met on the
platform, and then he was introduced to Detective Kerr.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you, Mr. Kerr,” said Nick. “I suppose
there’s no mystery about this case?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” replied Kerr, doubtfully. “I
think not.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was all settled.”</p>

<p>“Settled, Mr. Carter? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Nick smiled, and glanced at Folsom.</p>

<p>“Usually,” he said, “my friends do not have a brass
band to meet me when I begin to work.”</p>

<p>Folsom started, and looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He had heard it said that Nick Carter had a great objection
to working on a case when it was known that he
was at work.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Folsom, hastily; “I’ve been
excited this afternoon, or I would have sent for you secretly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
but there’s no brass band about it. Mr. Kerr is
the only one who knows that you are here.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Folsom; don’t worry,” responded Nick,
“but I’ll bet the cigars that more than Mr. Kerr know.”</p>

<p>“You’d win,” said Kerr. “Mr. Folsom spoke of sending
for you in the presence of fifty men.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” exclaimed Folsom, looking very awkward.</p>

<p>Nick laughed.</p>

<p>“Let it go,” he said, good-humoredly. “I don’t need to
bother with the case if I don’t want to. I presume Mr.
Kerr has the hang of it, anyway. So, unless there is real
trouble, Patsy and I can take the night train for the
East.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t, Mr. Carter,” said Kerr, earnestly.
“I do think that I can put my hand on the murderer, but
I’d like very much to get your opinion if not your assistance.”</p>

<p>“All right. There’ll be time enough for that while
we get dinner somewhere. Can you take us to a quiet
place?”</p>

<p>“We were going to the hotel where the crime was committed.
The Western Union manager is going to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
a boy there with a piece of evidence we need just as soon
as the boy gets back from a long errand.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Nick; “we’ll go to the hotel, but we
won’t go together, if you please. You and Folsom go
back together, and if anybody asks you about Nick Carter,
give them any kind of an evasive answer you choose, as
long as you make them understand that I’m not in town.
Then engage a private room for dinner——”</p>

<p>“We have done that already, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Good! What’s the number?”</p>

<p>“Fourteen, second floor.”</p>

<p>“Patsy and I will join you there in half an hour unless
there’s some hurry.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Kerr, a little doubtfully, “I don’t believe
there’s any hurry, for we can’t act till we get the messenger
boy’s evidence.”</p>

<p>“So long, then.”</p>

<p>Kerr and Folsom left Nick and Patsy inside the station,
where they had met.</p>

<p>“You don’t really hope to conceal the fact that you’re
in Denver, do you, Nick?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p>The great detective smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“When fifty men heard that I was sent for?” he returned,
quietly; “not quite.”</p>

<p>“Then, why do you make such a fuss about it? Why
not go along to the hotel openly?”</p>

<p>“Patsy,” said Nick, as he pretended to consult a pocket
time-table, “if the guilty man was one of that fifty, don’t
you think it likely that he would shadow Folsom and
Kerr, and follow them to the station to see if I came?”</p>

<p>“Yes! I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>

<p>“And if he did so, of course, he’s seen me.”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“And he wouldn’t follow the others out, but would
wait to see what became of me.”</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then——”</p>

<p>“You needn’t say any more, Nick. I see now. I’ve
spotted every man who had been in sight since we stepped
off the train.”</p>

<p>“About a dozen of them, eh?”</p>

<p>“Fully that.”</p>

<p>All through this talk each had been carefully looking
around the station, though no one there could have suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
that they were paying attention to anything but
themselves.</p>

<p>In fact, Nick had been taking in the situation from the
moment he met Kerr and Folsom.</p>

<p>“Let’s go into the waiting-room,” he said, as he put
away his time-table, “and buy a cigar and a newspaper.”</p>

<p>As they crossed the large room they watched very
carefully to see if any man was observing their movements.</p>

<p>The crime had happened too late in the afternoon for
the regular editions of the evening papers, but extras
were now out, and a big pile of them had just been
brought to the newsstand.</p>

<p>Several men were at the counter buying the papers.</p>

<p>Patsy went to the cigar case, and Nick asked for a
paper.</p>

<p>The boy behind the counter was very busy just then.</p>

<p>Nick had to wait his turn, which didn’t trouble him
any.</p>

<p>“Mr. Claymore!” the boy called, suddenly; “you forgot
your change.”</p>

<p>“Oh! did I?” said a man, who had bought several papers,
and was hurrying away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>He came back and reached his hand across the counter.</p>

<p>“Keep a nickel of it for your honesty,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thankee, Mr. Claymore.”</p>

<p>Nick bought his paper next, and Patsy joined him.</p>

<p>They went slowly to a corner of the waiting-room, and
sat down.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Nick, as he unfolded the paper, and
began to read about the death of the Rev. Mr. Judson.</p>

<p>“Well,” repeated Patsy, “there’s nobody around now
who was here when we came.”</p>

<p>“I thought not.”</p>

<p>Nick read for a moment, and then remarked:</p>

<p>“That’s an honest newsboy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Patsy, who had heard the talk about
the forgotten change.</p>

<p>“The man he spoke to was on the platform when we
arrived.”</p>

<p>“He was.”</p>

<p>That was all they said about it.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, neither of them had the slightest
suspicion of Claymore, any more than they had of any of
the dozen others who had stayed in sight while Kerr and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Folsom were there; but they remembered his face and
name.</p>

<p>That was a matter of habit with them.</p>

<p>“Look it over,” said Nick, passing the paper to Patsy.</p>

<p>While the young man read, Nick thought.</p>

<p>At last he said:</p>

<p>“I think we’ll call at the undertaker’s.”</p>

<p>The name of the undertaker who had taken charge of
Judson’s body was printed in the paper, and Nick inquired
the way to his place from the first policeman they met.</p>

<p>There was a crowd of curious idlers at the door, and
a man stood there, who at first was not going to let the
detectives in.</p>

<p>“We want to see the body of the clergyman who——”
Nick began.</p>

<p>“I know you do!” interrupted the man, crossly, “and
so does everybody else, but you can’t see!”</p>

<p>“Can’t see when I have eyes,” retorted Nick, with a
queer smile, and he pushed by the man into the building.</p>

<p>The man was astonished.</p>

<p>He had not expected this stranger to defy him, and
there was something so commanding in Nick’s quiet way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of doing things that he had let both detectives pass before
he knew it.</p>

<p>Then he followed them into the office, blustering:</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“It’s my business to be here,” said Nick, coldly. “I
am a detective, and my name is Nicholas Carter.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the undertaker, and his eyes grew
large. He did not seem to be able to take them off the
famous man, of whom he had heard so much. “Oh!” he
added, after a pause.</p>

<p>“If that makes a difference,” said Nick, “you may show
us the body.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, anything you want, Mr. Carter. Only too
proud.”</p>

<p>He led the way to a back room, and for a minute or
two Nick and Patsy stood there studying the still, cold
form.</p>

<p>“Can I do anything more for you?” asked the undertaker,
as they turned away.</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll see the clergyman’s friend, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Mr. Folsom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The hotel people, you see, Mr. Carter, told
me to take charge of the body, and I supposed it would
be a kind of charity case, as, of course, the hotel people
had no interest in the unfortunate man. But if Mr. Folsom
was his friend, perhaps he’d like to order a better
casket, don’t you see. If——”</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to Mr. Folsom about it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. Perhaps you’d like to look at some
of my caskets, and advise Mr. Folsom——”</p>

<p>“I’ll leave that to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! very well, sir; but if you don’t mind speaking to
him about the matter. It would be too bad to bury a
clergyman in an ordinary——”</p>

<p>By this time Nick and Patsy were out of hearing.</p>

<p>When they were about halfway to the hotel, Nick remarked:</p>

<p>“It wasn’t suicide.”</p>

<p>“No,” responded Patsy. “I could see that. The thing
that killed him was the breaking of the back of his skull
on the sidewalk; but he had a black and blue mark over
the right eye. That wasn’t made by his fall.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. It was made by the blow that sent him
reeling through the window.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“That information will make your friend Folsom feel
better, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“I judge so, as his telegram told me that he feared
suicide, and hoped that it was murder.</p>

<p>“But,” added Nick, “I don’t think I shall be in a hurry
to ease Folsom’s mind. We’ll wait till we have heard
the whole story before letting him know what we think.
It may be handy to give out the report that we believe
it a case of suicide.”</p>

<p>“I’m on,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>They found Kerr and Folsom waiting for them in room
fourteen, and they sat down at once to dinner.</p>

<p>While they were eating, Kerr told the whole story as
far as he knew it.</p>

<p>Naturally, he mentioned Claymore’s name as the witness
to Hank Low’s threats.</p>

<p>“Who is this Claymore?” asked Nick, as he lighted a
cigar at the end of the meal.</p>

<p>“He’s a Denver business man,” replied Kerr. “I have
no acquaintance with him. I believe he hasn’t been here
more than a year or so.”</p>

<p>“Less than a year, I guess,” said Folsom.</p>

<p>“Why, do you know him?” asked Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” replied Folsom, “except as I have talked with
him this afternoon, but I remember now that his name is
on the letters sent out by the oil company of which Judson
was president. Claymore is the secretary of the concern,
I believe.”</p>

<p>“But you hadn’t met him before?”</p>

<p>“No; and I didn’t hear his name till late in the day,
and even then I didn’t connect him with the company,
though I remember wondering a little how he knew so
much about poor Judson. You see, I was terribly excited.”</p>

<p>“No wonder.”</p>

<p>“It worries me a great deal,” continued Folsom, “to
think that my angry words might have led Judson to suicide.
He meant well, I am sure of that, and he was deceived
by the rascals as much as the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” murmured Nick; “seems to me that’s setting
Claymore out in rather a black light.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. I hadn’t given it much thought, for my
attention was taken up with the death of Judson, but I
have no doubt that Claymore is crooked. A dishonest
promoter, you know. One of these fellows who knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
how to swindle and keep on the right side of the law.
Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Maybe.”</p>

<p>Folsom looked as if he wished that Nick would say
more, but the detective was silent.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, a waiter came to the room to say that
a telegraph messenger wished to see Mr. Kerr.</p>

<p>“Send him up at once!” exclaimed Kerr.</p>

<p>The boy came in with his book.</p>

<p>“Boss said you wanted to see it,” said he, laying it on
the table, and going out again at once.</p>

<p>Kerr opened the book with great eagerness.</p>

<p>After looking down the columns of names and time
marks until he came to the one he wanted, his eyes
glowed with delight, and he passed the book to Nick,
with his finger on a certain line where the hotel clerk’s
name was written.</p>

<p>“There!” he cried, triumphantly; “see that?”</p>

<p>Nick looked.</p>

<p>He saw the clerk’s name in one column, and against it
in another column the figures, “3-31.”</p>

<p>“You see!” added Kerr, too excited to wait for Nick’s
opinion, “Hank Low did it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see,” responded Nick, slowly, “that Hank Low could
have done it.”</p>

<p>The reply disappointed Kerr.</p>

<p>He began to argue, but Nick interrupted.</p>

<p>“Excuse me a moment, gentlemen,” he said.</p>

<p>He arose and looked at Patsy.</p>

<p>They withdrew to a corner of the room, and whispered
together a moment.</p>

<p>Then Patsy went out.</p>

<p>Nick returned to the table.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Nick, again. “I don’t mean to interfere
with your handling of the case, Mr. Kerr——”</p>

<p>“Oh! bless you!” exclaimed Kerr, “that’s what we all
want. You do just what you think best, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I was going to say that I had forgotten
something and sent my assistant out to look after it.
Now, as to this time mark, it is very important. I can
see that.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Kerr, encouraged by the great detective’s
tone. “The testimony of the clerk cannot be
doubted. Here is the sure testimony that Hank Low
started for Judson’s room four minutes before the man
fell from his window. It is known that Low left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hotel and drove away just before word was brought in
that the man had fallen out. See?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then do you think we ought to lose any time before
arresting Low?”</p>

<p>“Do you say that he lives some eight miles from here?”</p>

<p>“Yes—about eight.”</p>

<p>“If he’s running away, he’s got a pretty good start.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason why we should get after him at
once. I declare, I wish I had run out there and hauled
him in before you came.”</p>

<p>“That might have been a good idea, but I don’t believe
there’s any use in hurrying now.”</p>

<p>Neither Kerr nor Folsom could understand Nick’s
delay.</p>

<p>The fact was he was waiting for Patsy.</p>

<p>He kept them talking for several minutes, and then
Patsy returned.</p>

<p>“Speak out,” said Nick. “I want these gentlemen to
hear what you have to report.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Patsy, “Claymore was in his office all the
time from one o’clock to ten minutes of four, when a messenger
came to tell him of Judson’s death.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.
<br />
<small>THE JOURNEY TO HANK LOW’S.</small></h2>


<p>Kerr and Folsom stared at each other and at Nick.</p>

<p>They were no fools.</p>

<p>It was clear enough what Patsy’s errand meant.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Folsom, in a low voice, “you suspected
Claymore?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not exactly,” Nick replied, “but I thought it
would be just as well to make it impossible to suspect him.
That was all.”</p>

<p>This remark did not convince either of the men.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have gone to this trouble,” said Folsom,
“if you hadn’t believed that he had a motive for the
crime.”</p>

<p>“As to motive,” replied Nick, “I can only guess, but
if Claymore is crooked and Judson was straight, isn’t it
possible that Judson threatened an exposure, and that
Claymore would try to prevent it?”</p>

<p>Kerr nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said, “but in the face of this evidence,”
and he tapped the messenger’s book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“It looks very bad for Hank Low,” admitted Nick.</p>

<p>“You think that Claymore set Low up to it?” remarked
Folsom.</p>

<p>“Do I?” inquired Nick, mildly.</p>

<p>“Well,” responded Folsom, “what are we to think?”</p>

<p>“Anything you please. I am willing to take hold of this
case, but, as I start under unusual difficulties, I want you
to let me go at it in my own way.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Carter,” said Kerr; “but I don’t see the
difficulties with all this evidence——”</p>

<p>Nick raised his hand.</p>

<p>“You’ve done first-rate work, Mr. Kerr,” he said. “The
evidence is sound as far as it goes. But it don’t go quite
far enough. The difficulties I refer to are the fact that
so many men know that I am here, and that the only
man who can say that Judson was murdered is dead.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>It was Kerr who spoke.</p>

<p>Folsom turned pale.</p>

<p>“You think, then,” he said, hoarsely, “that it was not a
case of murder at all?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so,” responded Nick; “but this I will say,
for, as I am in it now pretty deep, there’s no use in concealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
my thoughts from you two—but you mustn’t let
it go any further.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I don’t believe that Hank Low did it.”</p>

<p>Both Kerr and Folsom stared open-mouthed.</p>

<p>“By thunder!” said Kerr, slowly, “if any man but Nick
Carter said that——”</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>“You’d say he was a fool,” remarked Nick.</p>

<p>Kerr laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I should,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Nick; “you can think that of me
just as well as not, if you want to. Meantime, I’ll go out
and get acquainted with Hank Low.”</p>

<p>“To-night?”</p>

<p>“Now.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you want help?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. If I don’t come back with him as a voluntary
prisoner, Mr. Kerr, I’ll help you arrest him in the morning
and give you all the credit.”</p>

<p>“Credit be hanged, Mr. Carter! I’m not a jealous
idiot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Glad to hear you say so. You will lie low, then, till
you hear from me again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if it was any other man——”</p>

<p>“You’d lock him up as a dangerous lunatic. I know.
If I’m mistaken, I’ll own up frankly. Now, tell me the
way to Mason Creek.”</p>

<p>Kerr told him and advised him where to get a horse.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Nick, “you’ve described a roundabout
way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the road runs along a crooked valley, and around
the base of a big hill. If it was daylight, I might tell you
of a short cut over the hill, but you wouldn’t be able to
keep to the trail in the dark, to say nothing of the fact
that the woods on the hill are not safe just now.”</p>

<p>“Not safe?”</p>

<p>“No. There’s a scare about panthers out that way.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I shall have to keep my revolver handy.”</p>

<p>“It will be as well, but, of course, you’ll stick to the
road?”</p>

<p>“Yes, though you might tell me where the trail strikes
off.”</p>

<p>“It’s about four miles from here. You pass a perfectly
bare ledge a hundred yards long at your right, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
come to a stream. Instead of crossing the bridge, you can
follow up the stream. In the daytime, it’s plain enough,
and not a bad ride for a good horse.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Nick then gave some private instructions to Patsy, and
left them.</p>

<p>He went to the stable that Kerr had spoken of and
hired a horse.</p>

<p>It was about eight in the evening when he galloped
away, and at that hour it was quite dark.</p>

<p>The road took him quickly out of the city, and he was
soon in a wild country, where it would have been easy to
imagine that there wasn’t a town within a hundred miles.</p>

<p>The sky was clear, but the moon had not yet risen.</p>

<p>Nick did not ride hard, for he felt in no hurry.</p>

<p>It was somewhat less than half an hour after he started
when he noticed a long, high ledge at his right.</p>

<p>“Probably the place Kerr spoke of,” he thought.</p>

<p>He was glancing up at it, when his horse suddenly
leaped violently.</p>

<p>At the same instant there was a flash and a report from
the bushes at the other side of the road.</p>

<p>Nick’s hat flew from his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been singed by a rifle bullet.</p>

<p>His hand caught his revolver, but before it was drawn,
another shot came, and the horse staggered.</p>

<p>Nick slipped off quickly.</p>

<p>He ran a few paces and fell.</p>

<p>Then he lay still and watched.</p>

<p>The horse fell in earnest.</p>

<p>He was some two rods from the detective, and, as he
did not struggle after he went down, Nick knew that he
had been instantly killed.</p>

<p>Not another sound came from the bushes across the
road.</p>

<p>“Confound them!” thought Nick, who was not
scratched, except for the slight mark on his forehead.
“Why don’t they come out to make sure of their business?”</p>

<p>It was clearly a case of murder intended, for, if the unseen
villains had been robbers they would have crept forward
to go through the supposed dead man.</p>

<p>And, of course, it was plain that they knew whom they
were firing at.</p>

<p>Nobody would have shot at a stranger like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“This,” muttered Nick, “is what comes of starting on a
case with a brass band at the head of the procession.”</p>

<p>He meant by this that he believed the attempt to kill
him was connected with the death of Judson.</p>

<p>“It’s only too easy to see how it happened,” he thought.
“Everybody knew I was sent for, and there isn’t a doubt
that my arrival was spotted.</p>

<p>“Then it was easy to guess that I would go out to look
up Hank Low, and, as this is the only way to his place,
they were sure of having a shot at me.”</p>

<p>Nick listened as he lay there, but could hear no sound
of steps on the other side of the road.</p>

<p>The rushing of the stream a little beyond would have
drowned ordinary noises, so that the would-be murderers
could have got away without being noticed.</p>

<p>Apparently, that was what they did, for the detective
neither heard nor saw them.</p>

<p>He could only guess whether they believed that their
shots had done their work.</p>

<p>While he was waiting the moon rose.</p>

<p>As the sky was perfectly clear the land became almost
as light as day.</p>

<p>Nick at last got up cautiously and went to his horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The animal had fallen at the side of the road, and so
was out of the way of anyone passing.</p>

<p>Nick took off the saddle and bridle and hid them in the
bushes near.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay for the horse,” he thought, “but there’s no
sense in giving the saddle to the first thief who comes
along.”</p>

<p>He went back to the spot from which the shots had been
fired, and lit up the place with his pocket lantern.</p>

<p>If the scoundrels had accidentally dropped anything
that could serve as a clew, the detective would have found
it.</p>

<p>Nothing was there that could be of any use to him.</p>

<p>He saw traces of footprints on the grass and leaves, but
they were too faint to be measured.</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself on this matter, Nick started
on foot to finish his journey.</p>

<p>When he came to the stream, he did not cross the
bridge, but turned into the trail that Kerr had told him
about.</p>

<p>The moon made the path perfectly plain at the start,
and Nick took it, not only to save the long walk around
the base of the hill, but to save time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>For some reasons, he would have liked to go straight
back to Denver.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in his mind that his would-be murderers
had gone to the city.</p>

<p>If he was there, he might run across them.</p>

<p>But he believed it to be his first business to have a talk
with Hank Low, and so he went on.</p>

<p>The trail followed along the bank of the stream for
some distance, and then crossed it on a bridge of fallen
trees.</p>

<p>After that, it was very steep until it reached the summit
of the hill.</p>

<p>Although the trees were rather thick, the moonlight
came in on the eastern slope sufficiently to make the way
clear.</p>

<p>It was different when Nick began to descend upon the
other side.</p>

<p>That slope was in shadow, for the moon was not high
enough to light it, and more than once he found it difficult
to keep on the path.</p>

<p>Once he thought he had lost it, and he was thinking
that it would make him feel rather foolish to get lost at
night in these woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better have kept to the road,” he muttered, standing
still.</p>

<p>There was a very steep descent just before him.</p>

<p>He could see hardly anything, but he felt that the
ground was dipping sharply.</p>

<p>At the left there was a ridge of bare rock, and it
seemed that the trail led along the underside of it.</p>

<p>“This must be right,” he argued to himself. “By daylight
a horse would get down here easily enough. It’s the
right general direction, anyway, and I’ll chance it.”</p>

<p>Putting his hands on the bare rock at his left to steady
himself, he went slowly down.</p>

<p>It was not a high ledge, and he had come, as he
thought, about to the bottom, when there was a slight
noise behind and almost overhead that startled him.</p>

<p>His revolver was in his hand instantly.</p>

<p>There was a blinding flash not ten feet in front of him
and a deafening report.</p>

<p>Swish! went a bullet past his face.</p>

<p>Then there was a blood-curdling scream in the air
above, and the detective fell flat under a heavy body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.
<br />
<small>AN ARREST.</small></h2>


<p>Nick’s breath was knocked out of him, but he was not
stunned.</p>

<p>He knew partly what had happened.</p>

<p>It was a wild beast that had borne him to the ground.</p>

<p>Kerr’s remarks about the “panther scare” flashed upon
his memory.</p>

<p>Evidently, this beast had sprung upon him from the top
of the ledge.</p>

<p>He could feel the great limbs quivering, and one of the
claws scratched his hand.</p>

<p>All this was in a quarter of a second.</p>

<p>In the next second, Nick had exerted all his giant
strength, and rolled the beast over.</p>

<p>He got upon his knees and fired his revolver three times
in rapid succession at the huge carcass that he could feel
but not see in front of him.</p>

<p>Then a rough, surprised voice interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Geewhilikins! how many of ’em be ye, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Only one, stranger,” replied Nick, getting to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gosh! I thought it mought be a regiment by the way
ye fired. Got a double-quick action repeater, ain’t ye?”</p>

<p>Nick did not reply at once.</p>

<p>The beast was still clawing the ground frantically, and
he was not sure that another dose of lead was not necessary.</p>

<p>Then a little flame glowed in the darkness near by.</p>

<p>The man who had spoken to him had struck a match.</p>

<p>He held it first over the dying panther, for such it was,
and then remarked, in a satisfied tone:</p>

<p>“Done for. Four times dead, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Then he took a step forward and held the match close
to Nick’s face.</p>

<p>The men looked at each other in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>Nick saw a surprised, honest-looking face—that of a
hardy backwoodsman—and he caught a glimpse of the
rifle that the man held loosely in the hollow of his arm.</p>

<p>The backwoodsman saw a well-dressed tenderfoot,
whose coat was torn by the panther’s claw, whose face
was grimed with dirt and smeared with blood.</p>

<p>“By golly, stranger,” said the backwoodsman, “you’re
not jest fit to enter a beauty show—not but what ye may
be a slick-lookin’ chap when yer face is washed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“I reckon, pard,” he said, “that you saved my life.”</p>

<p>“Reckon I did,” returned the other, quietly, “but I come
close to killin’ you to do it.”</p>

<p>“I felt your bullet hiss past my face.”</p>

<p>“So? Should ha’ thought that mought have scared ye
to death.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’m used to that.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!”</p>

<p>“But I’m not used to enemies that spring on a man in
the dark without making any noise of warning. That’s
what the panther did.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’d ha’ had ye, sure, ef I hadn’t been here to
fire.”</p>

<p>“It was good luck.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I dunno about the luck of it. I was here on purpose.
Been a-lookin’ fer that critter.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“Yes; the pesky varmint has been worryin’ the life out
of us, and to-night I jest made up my mind that I’d get
him. I was pretty durn certain he’d be on the trail somewhere,
fer there’s enough as comes over it, you know, to
give the scent. I thought he’d be watchin’ fer prey, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
I didn’t have no idee that he’d git a chance at any. That’s
whar I’m s’prised. How come ye here, stranger?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you in a minute,” Nick answered; “just explain
to me first how you managed to take that shot in
time. I heard the beast springing just as you fired.”</p>

<p>“Why!” said the backwoodsman, “I was waitin’ here,
hopin’ the scent of me would bring the varmint along,
and, of course, I wasn’t makin’ no noise about it.</p>

<p>“Then I heard steps—your’n, you know—and I was
wondering about it as you come down the steep part of
the trail.</p>

<p>“Ef you look up at the top of the ledge thar you’ll see
that the risin’ moon makes the top line quite clear.</p>

<p>“Wal, I had my gun up, fer I didn’t know but what you
might be an enemy, when, all of a suddent, I saw a black
mass on the clear edge of the rock up thar.</p>

<p>“I knowed what it was, and the thing jumped.</p>

<p>“Thar wasn’t no time to think about it.</p>

<p>“I knowed the critter had spied you, and was springin’
fer ye, and I had to fire then, or not at all.</p>

<p>“So I blazed while the beast was in the air.</p>

<p>“It was too late to save you from a knock down, but
the critter was dead when he hit you. Them shots of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
yours was mighty slick ones, comin’ as fast as they did,
just as ef you was out practicin’ at a target, but they was
good powder and lead throwed away.”</p>

<p>“I can spare the powder and lead,” Nick responded,
“and at the time I couldn’t believe that the panther had
been hit in the heart. He was making a furious struggle.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” drawled the backwoodsman, “it takes them critters
some time to die. But how’d you come here?”</p>

<p>“I was going along the road on horseback when the animal
died suddenly.”</p>

<p>“Died!”</p>

<p>“Shot.”</p>

<p>“Gosh!”</p>

<p>“It was meant for me.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Robbers?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but they let me alone.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe they knowed you was handy with a gun?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder. Anyhow, I had business out this
way, so I came along. I took the trail to save time.”</p>

<p>“So! Business out here, you say.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m looking for Hank Low’s place. I presume
it’s not much further, is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hank Low’s! No, it ain’t much further—’bout two
gunshots.”</p>

<p>There was surprise and suspicion in the man’s tone.</p>

<p>“This trail will bring me there, I suppose,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“’Twill if ye follow it far enough.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall have to go on. I’m much obliged——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, stranger! What’s yer business with Hank
Low?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell that to Low.”</p>

<p>“Then you can tell it to me.”</p>

<p>“Why, are you——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am. My name’s Hank Low.”</p>

<p>Nick had guessed as much.</p>

<p>He held out his hand in the darkness and grasped that
of the man who had saved his life.</p>

<p>Low returned the grasp rather feebly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Low,” said Nick, “I am more obliged to you than
ever.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of me?” demanded Low, in a surly
tone.</p>

<p>“I want to talk to you about the land you sold some
months ago.”</p>

<p>“Do you belong to the company that bought it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The question came quickly, and Low’s voice was harsh.</p>

<p>There was no longer the good-natured tone in which
he had spoken while talking about the panther.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Nick, “I haven’t anything to do with the
company. I heard you were swindled.”</p>

<p>“That was it, stranger!” cried Low; “nothing short of
it. People say I was beat in a business deal, but I’m
tellin’ ye it wasn’t a squar’ deal.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know all about it.”</p>

<p>“What’s yer name?”</p>

<p>“Nicholas.”</p>

<p>“Be you a lawyer?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but I may be able to set you right in some
ways that you may not have thought of.”</p>

<p>“Wal, Mr. Nicholas, come down to the house. I’ve
got nothin’ to hold back, and ef you’re interested, you can
hear the whole story.”</p>

<p>Low talked as they walked along through the woods.</p>

<p>His voice continued to be harsh, as he told of the trick
that had been played upon him, but Nick saw that Claymore
had kept well within the law.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t fair,” thought the detective, “but it was what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
would be called a business deal, and Low was beaten. No
wonder he feels sore, but he can’t do anything about it.”</p>

<p>Of course, Low mentioned the Rev. Elijah Judson in
the course of his story.</p>

<p>His voice was more angry at this point.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand an out-an’-out villain,” said he,
“but it seems a durned sight worse when a preacher takes
to swindling, now don’t it, Mr. Nicholas?”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” replied Nick, “if I was sure that the
preacher had known that the scheme was unfair.”</p>

<p>“Know! How could he help it? Ain’t he president
of the company?”</p>

<p>“He was.”</p>

<p>“Was? Ef he ain’t now, then thar’s been a mighty
sudden change. Will ye come into the house, Mr. Nicholas?”</p>

<p>They had come to cleared land at the bottom of the hill,
and Low’s house was plainly seen in the moonlight a few
rods away.</p>

<p>None of the windows were lighted.</p>

<p>“No,” said Nick; “your wife and children are asleep
by this time, and we might wake them up. We can talk
out here just as well, can’t we?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>They sat down on a log near a shallow brook that
crossed the farm.</p>

<p>The moon rays reflected from the water straight into
Nick’s eyes, and his attention was curiously attracted.</p>

<p>“Must be handy having running water on your place,”
he remarked.</p>

<p>“Huh!” returned Low, “that’s whar you reckon wrong.
I thought so when I took this land, and I found out my
mistake too late.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Durned ef I know. The cattle won’t drink it, and I
don’t like the taste myself. I’ve had to dig a well up on
the hill thar and run the water to my house and barn
through pipes. That cost a good bit, but it was the only
way I could get water that would do.”</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment. Then Low said:</p>

<p>“I seen that cuss, Judson, to-day.”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He was up here with Claymore in the early
morning. I met ’em and we had a jawin’ match. I spoke
pretty hot, I reckon, but I can’t help it when I think how
I’ve been used. Thar’s my wife and children, you see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
I never have been able to give them the nice things I’d
like to. Ef they had let me in on the deal I mought ha’
got money enough to dress my children right smart and
send them to school in the city.”</p>

<p>“What should you say,” suggested Nick, “if you heard
that the company had got left in buying your land.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Got left? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Suppose that, after all, the land proves to be as worthless
as you thought?”</p>

<p>“B’gosh! ’twould serve ’em right.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the case.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I’m durn glad to hear it, but it don’t make me
feel any better toward those swindlers. I kind o’ thought
the preacher chap wanted to squar’ things, but I found I
was mistaken.”</p>

<p>“So? How was that?”</p>

<p>“He met me again in the city, and asked me to call on
him at the hotel. Reckon he had some new, slick scheme
up his sleeve.”</p>

<p>“Did you call on him?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t see me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s odd.”</p>

<p>“I thought so at the time. I told him I’d be there at
half-past three, and he said he’d wait for me. I was there
on time, and I went right up to his room.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“Say? He didn’t say nothin’. I didn’t see him. He
wouldn’t let me in.”</p>

<p>“Did he know you were there?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I knocked, and heard somebody stirrin’ in the
room. I’m sure of that. So, when he didn’t say ‘Come
in,’ I knocked again. ‘It’s Hank Low,’ says I, loud and
sharp. ‘Ef you want to see me, speak up quick, fer I
ain’t got any time to waste on ye.’</p>

<p>“Thar wa’n’t no answer to that, so I sung out that he
was off, and I waltzed downstairs fast.</p>

<p>“I was kind o’ ’fraid he might call me back, and I
didn’t want to hear him, for I was as mad as a hornet, and
I was afraid that ef him and me got together thar’d be
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Did you leave the hotel at once?”</p>

<p>“Yep. Drove straight home and didn’t see him then,
nor since.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you notice any excitement around the hotel as you
drove away?”</p>

<p>“Excitement? Reckon not. A feller I know spoke to
me, but I was too durn mad to answer him decent.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t you notice anything else?”</p>

<p>Low thought a moment.</p>

<p>“Now I think of it,” he said, “I do remember seein’
two or three men runnin’ down the street at the side of the
hotel, but I was so durn mad that I didn’t turn my head.
The hull town mought ha’ been on fire fer all I cared.
I was thinkin’ of how I’d been cheated.”</p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>If Nick had had any doubt of this man’s innocence it
was all gone now.</p>

<p>Low was no actor; just a plain, honest farmer—bullheaded,
quick-tempered and unreasonable, perhaps, but
no murderer.</p>

<p>He couldn’t have told his story of the afternoon in that
straightforward way, if he had been guilty.</p>

<p>“Mr. Low,” said Nick, after a pause, “Judson is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” repeated the farmer, in a tone that showed
the greatest surprise. “How long since, Mr. Nicholas?”</p>

<p>“He died while you were at the door to his room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!”</p>

<p>“He was murdered.”</p>

<p>“Wha-a-a-t!”</p>

<p>“Thrown from his window to the sidewalk.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord! Then that was what those men were
runnin’ for.”</p>

<p>“Yes—they went to pick him up.”</p>

<p>The farmer sat with his elbows on his knees, staring
open-mouthed at Nick.</p>

<p>“That’s awful, ain’t it?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“It is,” said Nick, “and there’s something else that is
still more awful.”</p>

<p>He paused, but Low said nothing.</p>

<p>“It is perfectly well known,” Nick added, “that you
started up to Judson’s room just before the deed.”</p>

<p>Low became very attentive, but it was plain that the
truth was not dawning on him yet.</p>

<p>“And that you came down again in a hurry,” added the
detective, “immediately afterward. It is also well known
that you threatened Mr. Judson——”</p>

<p>This was enough.</p>

<p>The light burst upon the honest farmer suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>In the moonlight, his face was ghastly white, and his
voice almost choked, as he said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Nicholas, you don’t mean to set thar an’ tell me
thar’s folks as say I done it?”</p>

<p>“That is what they say,” returned Nick, quietly.</p>

<p>Low groaned, and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>“My wife has often told me,” he sobbed, “that that
sharp tongue of mine would git me into trouble. I see!
It all fits in like the handle into an ax.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Nick. “There isn’t going to be as much
trouble as you think for. I told you that I was not a
lawyer, but that I might be able to help you. I am a detective,
Mr. Low.”</p>

<p>The farmer uncovered his face and looked frightened
now.</p>

<p>“I said my name was Nicholas,” the detective went on,
“and that was the truth, but only a part of it. My last
name is Carter.”</p>

<p>Low started.</p>

<p>“From New York?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The farmer shook from head to toes. He laid his trembling
hands on Nick’s arm, and began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, I’ve hearn tell of you, that you’re keen and
hard when it comes to criminals, but you’re straight with
innocent men. I swear——”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to,” interrupted Nick; “you are as innocent
as I am, and I know it. I believed it when I
started out to see you, but I am going to arrest you for
murder, nevertheless.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter! I don’t understand! What will my poor
wife say?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t let her know. I want you to understand,
though. Suspicion has been put on you by an enemy of
yours. Now, if I lock you up over night, it will make
this enemy believe that I have finished my work. See?”</p>

<p>“You want to blind him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Then I can hunt for the real murderer in my
own way.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>Low was perfectly quiet. He did not talk or act like the
hot-tempered man who had threatened Mr. Judson.</p>

<p>“You can tell your wife,” said Nick, “that a man wants
you to go to the city on business about the land deal. Let
her think that some good luck has come your way. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
don’t think you’ll have to disappoint her afterward. Then
hitch up your horse, and we’ll go back together.”</p>

<p>Low agreed to this without argument. He went into
the house and was gone several minutes. Then he went
into the barn and hitched up. A little later, he and the
detective were jogging over the road toward Denver.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.
<br />
<small>SNAPPED.</small></h2>


<p>Kerr was at police headquarters when Nick arrived with
his prisoner.</p>

<p>His eyes glowed triumphantly when he saw them
come in.</p>

<p>“You got him?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nick, “he surrendered when I told him
how strong the evidence was against him.”</p>

<p>“I wonder he hadn’t run away.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, he didn’t know that a messenger had
come in with a telegram just ahead of him.”</p>

<p>Kerr chuckled.</p>

<p>“This will be a great story for the newspaper fellows,”
he said. “They’ve been here all the evening till about
half an hour ago. I told them to come back later.”</p>

<p>Nick looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>He wondered if it would be necessary to give the honest
farmer the shame of having it printed that he had been
arrested for murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose the newspaper boys know that I am on the
case,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—everybody knows it.”</p>

<p>“But they don’t know that I went to Mason Creek?”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon they’ve guessed it. Newspaper reporters
are good at that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Do they know that Low was under suspicion?”</p>

<p>“Sure! They got that from the hotel clerk.”</p>

<p>“Humph!”</p>

<p>Nick was a little disgusted.</p>

<p>When he handled a case in his own way, hotel clerks
and others were not allowed to tell what they knew, and
he took pains that nobody should know too much, anyway,
until he got ready to tell them.</p>

<p>“See here, Kerr,” he said, earnestly, “I’d hold the reporters
off for a time, if I were in your place.”</p>

<p>Kerr glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p>“They’ll be hungry for news pretty soon,” said he.</p>

<p>“And perhaps I can give them a little more, and a better
story, if they wait a bit.”</p>

<p>“Why——”</p>

<p>“Low isn’t the only one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“I want to consult with my assistant before telling about
this arrest.”</p>

<p>“You have a clew that you haven’t spoken of, then?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Just lock Low up without putting anything
on the blotter for a little while. Give me an hour to see
what I can do.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Carter, if you say so. But what shall I
tell the reporters?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’ll be back inside an hour.”</p>

<p>Nick whispered a few words to Low, telling him to
keep his courage up and his mouth shut, and went away.</p>

<p>He had asked Kerr to wait an hour, without any idea
as to what he should or could do.</p>

<p>Nick felt that he had only got to the beginning of the
case.</p>

<p>He was certain of Low’s innocence, though he might
not be able to convince a jury of it.</p>

<p>It was necessary, then, to find the proof of Low’s innocence,
as well as proof that somebody else was guilty.</p>

<p>Who that somebody else was, he could not guess.</p>

<p>He still thought of Claymore, in spite of the alibi that
Patsy had found to be sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Claymore evidently had not committed the murder,
but that he knew more than he had told, Nick was certain.</p>

<p>Could any evidence be got in an hour that would save
Low from being published in the papers as a suspected
murderer?</p>

<p>Low’s horse and wagon were at the door of the station.</p>

<p>Nick got in and drove to the stable where he had hired
a horse.</p>

<p>There he explained what had happened to the horse,
paid the damage, and returned the saddle and bridle that
he had picked up on the way back with his prisoner.</p>

<p>Then he went to the hotel in the hope of finding
Patsy.</p>

<p>He made the round of the rooms on the ground floor
without finding him.</p>

<p>As he was passing the desk, the clerk spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said he, “but aren’t you Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“There’s a young man waiting here to see you. Your
assistant told me to point him out to you as soon as you
came in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“That man sitting near the door with a parcel in his
hands.”</p>

<p>Nick went up to the young man.</p>

<p>“Are you waiting for Mr. Carter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the young man, rising.</p>

<p>“I am he.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, sir, I understand you are working on the
Judson matter. The man who is supposed to have committed
suicide.”</p>

<p>“I have been looking into it a little.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’ve got something here to show you. I
showed it to your assistant, and he said it would interest
you.”</p>

<p>The young man went to undoing his parcel, and three
or four idlers drew near.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Nick.</p>

<p>He led the young man to the desk and asked for a
room.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, they were in a room alone, and Nick
took the parcel.</p>

<p>Unfolding the paper with which it was wrapped, he
found a photograph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a clean-cut picture of the Rev. Mr. Judson’s fall
from the hotel window.</p>

<p>Nick looked earnestly at the picture.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to get this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am an amateur photographer,” was the reply. “I
work in the office at the top of the building just across the
Street from the hotel. Yesterday I got hold of some
new plates that a friend had advised me to use, but I
had no time to try them till this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“And you tried them on this scene?” asked Nick,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Without meaning to, yes. You see, I knew it would
be Sunday before I would have time to take any pictures
that I cared about, but I wanted to be sure that the plates
were all right.</p>

<p>“So, when there was a dull time in the office work, I
got out my camera, which I had with me, and went to the
window.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much of a view from here, but I thought
I’d take a couple of shots at the roofs, just to test the
plates.</p>

<p>“I had the camera all ready, when I accidentally touched
the button.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“That made me hot, for I had spoiled a plate.</p>

<p>“I pointed it carefully from the best view I could get
from there, and tried again.</p>

<p>“Just as I pushed the button, I heard cries on the street,
and, looking down, saw a man lying on the sidewalk, and
several others running toward him.</p>

<p>“Of course, I went down to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>“It was Mr. Judson.</p>

<p>“Later I went back, and as soon as possible after supper,
while there was yet sunlight, I developed my second
plate.</p>

<p>“I didn’t bring that with me, for it wouldn’t interest
you. But it came out so good that I thought I might as
well see what I had caught on the first plate, when the
thing went off before I knew.</p>

<p>“That picture in your hand was what I caught.”</p>

<p>He paused, but Nick said nothing, and the young man
added:</p>

<p>“I had heard your name mentioned in connection with
the matter, and, as people said it was a case of suicide, I
thought I ought to show you what I had caught.”</p>

<p>Nick drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“Well!” he said, “for once the brass band has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
useful. I wanted to work unknown, but the fact that I
am known to be on the case has brought me a piece of
evidence that otherwise I might never have discovered.”</p>

<p>Again he looked at the picture.</p>

<p>“This lets Low out of it,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Kerr’s theory was that Low had made a mad rush for
the clergyman as soon as he entered the room, pushed
him from the window, and then hurried out and down the
stairs.</p>

<p>The amateur photograph showed not only the unfortunate
clergyman falling headforemost toward the sidewalk,
but above him the forms of two men at the window.</p>

<p>They were not looking out, but rather in the act of
dodging back.</p>

<p>These two were outlined very dimly, but the picture
was clear enough to show that there were two of them,
and that their arms were half-raised, as would be natural
if they had just thrown a body away from them.</p>

<p>Unluckily, the faces were not at all distinct.</p>

<p>Try as he would, and Nick used his magnifying glass,
he could not make them out to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>While he was still studying it, there came a knock at
the door, and Patsy hurried in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“The clerk told me you were here?” he said. “Well?”</p>

<p>“It’s a good piece of evidence,” responded Nick; “if
only this young man had had a little more luck! We
could get along without the picture of Judson if we only
had a clean-cut picture of the two murderers.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Patsy, confidently, “I know who
they are.”</p>

<p>Nick looked quickly at his assistant.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the photographer.</p>

<p>“Will you leave this with us?” he asked. “I shall see
that you are well paid for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t care for any pay,” replied the young man.
“I shall be glad if it helps you. Good-night.”</p>

<p>He left them, and Patsy made his report.</p>

<p>“I laid for Claymore, as you told me,” he said, “and
after chasing him around town for a while, I found at
last that he had gone to the office of the oil company. He
spent the whole evening there.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“There was nothing for me to do but stay around. I
was pretty sure that any attempt to find out what Claymore
was doing would make him suspicious. So I didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
go into the building even, but stayed outside on the other
side of the street.</p>

<p>“It was a dull wait till a while ago.</p>

<p>“Then something happened.</p>

<p>“A man came hurrying up the street and another man
after him. I thought I had seen them both before somewhere,
from their motions, but I couldn’t see their faces in
the dark. I suppose I wouldn’t have bothered to get a
closer look, if they hadn’t stopped right in the entrance to
the building where Claymore has his office.</p>

<p>“That interested me, and I crossed over.</p>

<p>“One man was holding the other back.</p>

<p>“‘’Tain’t safe to wait any longer,’ said the one who got
there first.</p>

<p>“‘And it ain’t half so safe to try to see him here,’ the
other answered. ‘Don’t be a fool! You see, his windows
are still lighted, and he’s busy. When he gets through,
he’ll come, as he said he would. Let him alone now and
come back.’</p>

<p>“They talked a little more back and forth, and finally
the second man got the first one to go away.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know then what they were talking about, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
I don’t know now, but I dropped Claymore for a time
and followed those two men.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Because I knew them. One was Nat Hamilton, the
leader of the gang we had a tussle with in Helena, and
the other was his right-hand man, Jack Thompson.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.
<br />
<small>DADDY DREW’S DIVE.</small></h2>


<p>“What! those two scoundrels!” cried Nick.</p>

<p>“Yes, you were right when you prophesied that we
would come upon them again.”</p>

<p>Nick looked suddenly at the picture.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he muttered, “I believes I know them now.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a doubt of it,” said Patsy, “but you couldn’t
swear to it to the satisfaction of a jury.”</p>

<p>“True, and the jurymen could look at the picture for
themselves, and see that the likenesses are not there.
We’ve got to get more evidence than this, Patsy. Nobody
saw them do the deed. This picture almost tells the
story, but not quite. But go on. You must have more
to tell.”</p>

<p>“A little. I shadowed Hamilton and Thompson to a
dive where you and I have been before—Daddy Drew’s.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Nick. “It means a fight with all the
crooks in Denver, if we go there.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s where they are, and they’re waiting for
Claymore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right. We’ll go there and get them, then, if we
decide we’d better arrest them. Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Not quite. Knowing they were there to stay, I ran
back to Claymore’s office. He had just put out his lights
and was leaving the building.</p>

<p>“He went to police headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Did you go in, too?”</p>

<p>“With a disguise, yes. I saw that Claymore had a
private talk with Kerr. Then he went out again.”</p>

<p>“How did he look?”</p>

<p>“Rocky, but he was saying, ‘Very good,’ and ‘Quite
right’ to Kerr.”</p>

<p>“That means that Kerr told him,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Told him what?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p>“What I have done. He shouldn’t have said a word,
but I can understand how he should make such a slip, for
Claymore was the first to direct suspicion at Hank Low.
What became of Claymore?”</p>

<p>“He went home. He lives in a boarding house——”</p>

<p>“We must have him! Come on!”</p>

<p>They left the hotel together hurriedly.</p>

<p class="asterism">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>In a corner of Daddy Drew’s dive—the worst place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Denver—sat the two men who had escaped from Nick
Carter in Helena a short time before.</p>

<p>They had liquor in front of them, but they drank little.</p>

<p>Every time the door opened to admit a newcomer, they
looked that way eagerly.</p>

<p>The place was pretty well filled.</p>

<p>All the scum of the city seemed to drift in there, for it
was known that once inside the doors a man need not leave
until morning.</p>

<p>Daddy let his customers sleep on the floor, if they had
nowhere else to go.</p>

<p>At last it was closing hour.</p>

<p>The doors were locked, and the curtains pulled tightly
across the windows.</p>

<p>Jack Thompson muttered an oath.</p>

<p>“He’s going to bilk us,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Not him,” responded Hamilton. “Wait, I tell you.
The night’s young yet. He can’t afford to bilk us, don’t
you see?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. He might skip——”</p>

<p>“But he’s not suspected! He’s got every reason to stay,
for here is where the money is. He’ll get around before
the night is over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope he brings his wad with him.”</p>

<p>“He will.”</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment, and then Jack muttered:</p>

<p>“I’d have liked it better if he’d paid us for the other
job and not asked us to tackle the detective.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! what scares you so?”</p>

<p>“Nick Carter. Ain’t that enough?”</p>

<p>“Nick Carter is dead.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe it, Nat?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell Claymore so.”</p>

<p>Jack shuddered.</p>

<p>“I see you don’t believe it,” he said; “But I hope Claymore
comes along and believes it. Then he’ll pay us, and
we can skip before the cuss comes to life.”</p>

<p>Nat Hamilton smiled.</p>

<p>“He won’t come to life if he’s dead,” he remarked,
coolly, “any more than the preacher chap will.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Jack, and they were silent again.</p>

<p>Not less than thirty men were in the place.</p>

<p>They were fairly quiet, for they knew that loud noise
might bring the police down on the dive, and then their
night’s shelter would be closed up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>But they were a tough lot, and every man of them
would have joined in to help anybody there if a policeman,
or a dozen of them, had come in to make an arrest.</p>

<p>This was so well known that the police usually waited
for their men to come out before trying to arrest them.</p>

<p>There hadn’t been a murder in Daddy Drew’s for a long
time, and a tough present on this night remarked to another
that one was about due.</p>

<p>A few minutes after twelve, there was a light knock
at the door.</p>

<p>The bartender, who went to it and looked through a
slide, came back to Nat.</p>

<p>“Feller out there askin’ fer youse,” he said.</p>

<p>Both men got up, but Nat pushed Jack back into his
chair.</p>

<p>“I’ll see who ’tis,” he said.</p>

<p>He went to the door and looked through the slide.</p>

<p>Claymore’s face appeared there as if it were a picture in
a frame.</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” said Nat to the bartender; “friend o’
mine. Let him in.”</p>

<p>The door was opened, and Nat’s friend came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>As he went to the back of the room silently with Nat,
many curious glances were cast at him.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked one of another.</p>

<p>And those who answered came pretty near to guessing
the truth.</p>

<p>“Some fellow,” said they, “who gets others to do his
work for him.”</p>

<p>Two or three knew Claymore by sight, and they were
not surprised.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the newcomer, when he sat down at the
table in the corner, and three heads were put close together.</p>

<p>“We done it,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>“He’s dead as a nail.”</p>

<p>There was a short pause. Then, in a low voice:</p>

<p>“You lie, Nat.”</p>

<p>Both the criminals started angrily, but they gritted their
teeth and looked at the man, who added:</p>

<p>“He’s just as alive as I am. Less than an hour ago he
brought Hank Low in on a charge of murder.”</p>

<p>“Then,” exclaimed Jack; “it’s all right, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“No! it isn’t all right. Carter believes that Low is innocent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and he has arrested him for a bluff. He knows
that you did it.”</p>

<p>Jack turned ghastly pale.</p>

<p>Nat looked as if he didn’t believe it.</p>

<p>“He can’t have any evidence against us,” said he.</p>

<p>“He’ll get it. You know Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>“But how can he get it? Nobody saw us.”</p>

<p>“Somebody must have seen you enter the hotel.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Nat, positively; “I swear, Claymore, we got
in without being seen.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me how you managed that.”</p>

<p>“No, for you sent us down the road on the chance of a
pot shot at the detective. I’ll tell you. There’s an office
building next to the hotel, you know, with an alley between.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“We went in there and found an empty room. It was
easy enough to pick the lock and get in. Then we found
that a short board would reach from the window to an
open window in the hotel. Jack went out and swiped a
board from the place where they’re putting up a new
building. At twenty-five minutes past three we put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
board out, crawled across and got to the preacher’s room
without meeting anybody.”</p>

<p>“And left the board there?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” replied Nat. “We took the board
in and hid it in a closet until we had tumbled the preacher
out of the window. Then we slipped back, returned to the
office building by the same way, and so went down to the
street.”</p>

<p>“And left the board——”</p>

<p>“Of course! We weren’t going to lug it around in
daylight. What harm could it do in an empty room?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no harm, of course,” very sarcastically. “Nobody
would find it, and wonder about it; oh, no!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Claymore?”</p>

<p>“I mean this: Nick Carter has that infernally sharp
Patsy along with him. I believe you know Patsy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, confound him!”</p>

<p>“So I say! but while Nick went out to get Low, Patsy
was nosing around town. He probably found that board;
he probably saw you two fellows, and knew you; then he
put two and two together, and the long and short of it is
that Carter is after you.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be hanged, sure!” groaned Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s only one way out of it, boys.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Carter will come here to a dead certainty. He knows
the town, and knows that this is the place where you
would most likely hang out. He’ll come here.”</p>

<p>“Then he’ll get a warm time of it,” said Nat.</p>

<p>“If you think so, stay. But you know the Carters. If
you want a chance to escape, take it now. There’s a train
for San Francisco runs through here in half an hour.
You can catch it.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Jack, rising.</p>

<p>“Hold on a bit,” said Nat. “Who pays the freight?
We haven’t had our money yet.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it, but I’ll be hanged myself if I pay you in
here. Get out on the street. I’ll go with you part way
to the station, and settle with you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t wait,” urged Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s good advice. Carter may break in here any
minute, or he may sneak in in disguise. That’s his most
likely way, and then you’ll be nabbed before you know it.”</p>

<p>Nat was rather pale now.</p>

<p>“I’ll give him a fight for it, if he comes,” he muttered,
but he got up, and the three went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were on the street Nat turned.</p>

<p>“Will you settle now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in such a hurry,” was the sharp reply. “Your
only safety is to get away from this place. Walk along
toward the railroad. I’ll be close at your heels until I
think it’s safe to stop and settle.”</p>

<p>Nat hesitated.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to try to skip without paying!” he
hissed, savagely.</p>

<p>“I’ll settle with you both before you get to the station.
Get a move on! Carter may be here the next second.”</p>

<p>The crooks started away, looking back frequently to see
that Claymore was following.</p>

<p>He kept about half a block behind them.</p>

<p>Nobody but themselves seemed to be on the streets.</p>

<p>There was a drunken man staggering along some distance
ahead, but he didn’t count.</p>

<p>He, too, disappeared around a corner before the crooks
came to it.</p>

<p>When they were about to pass that corner a quiet voice
behind them said:</p>

<p>“This will do. We’ll settle here.”</p>

<p>“All right,” responded Nat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Both men halted and turned about.</p>

<p>They looked into the muzzles of two revolvers.</p>

<p>The face back of the hands that held the weapons was
not that of their employer, Claymore, but that of their
deadly enemy, Nick Carter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.
<br />
<small>HANK LOW’S LUCK.</small></h2>


<p>Claymore was not in his boarding house when Nick and
Patsy arrived there.</p>

<p>He had come in and gone out shortly afterward.</p>

<p>Where he had gone, or in what direction, nobody could
say.</p>

<p>Possibly to Daddy Drew’s to meet the desperadoes he
had hired to commit murder; but Nick didn’t believe it.</p>

<p>“That long work in his office this evening means something
else,” said Nick. “He’s got another plot up his
sleeve. I’ll go to Daddy Drew’s and get those men.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, he had turned his face into a copy of Claymore’s
and had been admitted easily.</p>

<p>Nat had said he would put up a stiff fight if he should
meet Carter, and he kept his word.</p>

<p>Probably he reckoned that the detective would wish
to take him alive, for he did not surrender when he saw
the revolver pointed at his heart.</p>

<p>Instead, he made a quick rush at Nick, trying to knock
up both his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective was quite ready for that.</p>

<p>It was true that he wished to take the men alive, and he
did not fire.</p>

<p>He had hoped they would be scared into quiet surrender.</p>

<p>When the attack came, he dropped both weapons to the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>Letting drive with his fists, he caught Nat on the chest,
and knocked the wind out of him.</p>

<p>But the crook did not fall.</p>

<p>He staggered against Jack, who at first was going to
give up.</p>

<p>Seeing that the weapons had been dropped, Jack joined
in and made a desperate effort for freedom.</p>

<p>He caught his partner and kept him from falling.</p>

<p>Then both together sailed into the detective.</p>

<p>“Why!” said Nick, with a laugh, “come on, if that’s
what you want.”</p>

<p>His arms shot out like lightning flashes, and every blow
landed, but the crooks kept too close for him to give
them settlers.</p>

<p>And, after a moment, Jack retreated and drew his revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>That was a moment of peril for Nick, as he was busy
just then with Nat.</p>

<p>And Nat, seeing the chance, pretended to be knocked
down.</p>

<p>This was to give Jack a chance to shoot.</p>

<p>Up came the ruffian’s revolver, but before he could aim,
around the corner rushed the drunken man whom they
had seen.</p>

<p>This man threw his arms about Jack’s neck, and bore
him silently to the ground.</p>

<p>“Put the bracelets on him, Patsy,” called Nick.</p>

<p>“They’re on,” replied the “drunken man,” calmly.</p>

<p>Nick had leaped upon Nat, and in a second had him
ironed.</p>

<p>“This is the way I settle,” he said, as he stood up.</p>

<p>The prisoners cursed furiously, but if that did them
any good nobody knew it.</p>

<p>Nick picked up his revolvers, and then he and Patsy
marched the prisoners to headquarters.</p>

<p>Kerr was still there, and he was surrounded by eager
reporters.</p>

<p>“Here are the murderers,” said Nick. “Low is innocent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>He produced the amateur’s photograph, and told the
story as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>“The chief villain is yet to be caught,” he concluded.
“I think we shall find the clew to him in his office.”</p>

<p>There was a great deal of excitement at headquarters,
and many questions were asked.</p>

<p>Nick told the reporters to make it plain that Low’s arrest
had been a fake.</p>

<p>“When it’s all settled,” he said, “I’ll give you the details,
or you can get them from Kerr, who deserves a great
deal of credit for the way he picked up evidence. I’ve
got work ahead between now and morning.”</p>

<p>Low was released, of course, and he went with Nick,
Patsy and Kerr to Claymore’s office.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be in order there, but Nick picked
the lock of Claymore’s desk, and found a lot of papers
there on which the man had been at work during the long
evening.</p>

<p>There were maps of the country around Mason Creek,
some printed, some roughly drawn with a pencil.</p>

<p>There was also the deed which Low had given to the
oil company when he sold a piece of his land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Using his magnifying glass, Nick saw that some
changes had been made in the deed.</p>

<p>Words and figures had been carefully scratched out and
others inked in.</p>

<p>“I had an idea this was what he was up to,” said Nick.
“We shall find Claymore out at Low’s farm.”</p>

<p>The four men set out for Mason Creek soon after.</p>

<p>Nick went in Low’s wagon, and Patsy and Kerr in one
they hired.</p>

<p>When they came to the beginning of the trail, Nick got
down and told the others to drive slowly on.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the short cut,” said he. “You keep on by the
road, and if he escapes me he’ll run into your hands.”</p>

<p>As it was late in the spring, light came early.</p>

<p>The day was beginning to break when Nick passed the
dead body of the panther.</p>

<p>As he approached nearer Low’s house he moved cautiously.</p>

<p>Coming to the edge of the cleared land, he saw a man
busy with a shovel at a little distance.</p>

<p>It was Claymore.</p>

<p>He was digging a hole for the purpose of setting a
boundary post in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The post had been taken up from a spot some distance
farther down the stream that crossed the farm.</p>

<p>Claymore’s scheme was to change the boundaries of the
land bought by the oil company so that they should include
twice as much as had been bought.</p>

<p>That was why the deed had been changed, and it explained
the maps in Claymore’s desk.</p>

<p>Nick watched the rascal for a few minutes, and then
walked toward him.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you put the post up where it will take in
Hank Low’s house and barn?” he asked.</p>

<p>Claymore turned at the sound, and caught up a revolver
that was lying on the ground beside him.</p>

<p>He fired hastily, and the bullet went wild.</p>

<p>Nick had him covered.</p>

<p>“Try again,” said the detective, “if you think you can do
your own murdering.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he was advancing upon the man.</p>

<p>Claymore gave one desperate look around.</p>

<p>He saw two wagons coming up the road.</p>

<p>Then he dropped his weapon, sat down on the ground,
and put his hands to his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“You haven’t as much nerve as I thought you had,” remarked
Nick.</p>

<p>He put handcuffs on the prisoner, and waited for the
others to come up.</p>

<p>“I can tell you all about it,” said Nick, then. “This
man Claymore found that he had bought land where the
oil was scarce. He was so anxious to get the land cheap
that he didn’t dare to prospect thoroughly. If he had
done his work well, he would have seen that the place
for oil wells is further up the stream and nearer Low’s
house.</p>

<p>“He found that out after a while, and then schemed
to get possession of the rest of the farm without paying
for it.</p>

<p>“Seeing that Judson would expose the crooked work of
the company, he had him murdered by a couple of desperadoes
who drifted into Denver just in time for the
job.</p>

<p>“Then he did some forgery work on the deed to make
it show that he had bought a good many acres more than
he really had, and to back up the deed he had to come
out here and change the boundary posts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“His best chance for doing that was while Low was
locked up.</p>

<p>“That was why he didn’t go to meet his confederates
early at Daddy Drew’s.</p>

<p>“His confederates have told me all about the murder
of Judson, so that they are sure to be hanged, and one
of them, Jack Thompson, is ready to confess and tell just
how Claymore hired them to do the deed.</p>

<p>“Between Jack’s confession and what I heard them say,
we have got a complete case.</p>

<p>“If I was in Hank Low’s place I’d give up farming on
land where the water is covered with oil, and dig wells.</p>

<p>“I noticed the appearance of the water in the stream
when I was talking with Low earlier in the night, and I
knew that the place to dig for oil is near his house.”</p>

<p>It was soon proved that Nick was entirely right.</p>

<p>The upper part of Low’s farm was rich in oil.</p>

<p>The farmer acted more than honestly about it.</p>

<p>With the help of Folsom, who was greatly pleased to
learn that the clergyman had not committed suicide, Low
got the names and addresses of all who had put money into
the scheme of which Judson had been president. And in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the end nobody who had invested with the clergyman lost
anything.</p>

<p>No attempt was made to get back the part of the farm
that was sold, for the land wasn’t worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Jack Thompson confessed, but that did not save him
from severe punishment. He was put in prison for life,
and Claymore and Hamilton were hanged.</p>

<p>Nick Carter and his faithful assistant, Patsy, were content
at last.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold p1">Thrilling Adventure</p>


<p class="p2">For many years we have been urged by readers who like Western
stories to publish some tales about the adventures of Diamond Dick.
Therefore, we decided to have a new series of stories based upon the
adventures of this famous Western character, and to put them in a
line called GREAT WESTERN LIBRARY, together with stories about
Buffalo Bill, by Col. Prentiss Ingraham.</p>

<p>Thus, in this line two of the most famous of all American characters
join hands. The so-called society stories with a kick in them
come and go, but these clean, wholesome tales of the West give a
clean-cut picture of the lives and characters of the men who carried
the advance banners of civilization westward.</p>

<p>There are Indian stories, cowboy stories, outlaw stories, all sorts
of stories of adventures out West. Each one is clean and decent,
even if it is thrilling.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold large p2">BOOKS THAT NEVER GROW OLD</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xxlarge">Alger Series</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold">Clean Adventure Stories for Boys</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold p1">The Most Complete List Published</p>


<p class="p2">The following list does not contain all the books that Horatio Alger
wrote, but it contains most of them, and certainly the best.</p>

<p>Horatio Alger is to boys what Charles Dickens is to grown-ups. His
work is just as popular to-day as it was years ago. The books have
a quality, the value of which is beyond computation.</p>

<p>There are legions of boys of foreign parents who are being helped
along the road to true Americanism by reading these books which are
so peculiarly American in tone that the reader cannot fail to absorb
some of the spirit of fair play and clean living which is so characteristically
American.</p>

<p>In this list will be included certain books by Edward Stratemeyer,
Oliver Optic, and other authors who wrote the Alger type of stories,
which are equal in interest and wholesomeness with those written by
the famous author after which this great line of books for boys is
named.</p>

<p class="no-indent center bold xxlarge p2">VALUE</p>


<p class="p2">Although literature is generally regarded as
more or less of a luxury, there is such a thing
as getting your money’s worth, and a little more,
in the way of literature.</p>

<p>For seventy years the firm of STREET &amp;
SMITH has specialized in the publication of
fiction. During all this time everything bearing
our imprint represented good value for the
money.</p>

<p>When, about thirty years ago, we began the
publication of a series of paper bound books,
which has since become world famous by the
name of “The S &amp; S Novel,” we did our best
to publish the right sort of fiction. The sales
of these books proved that we have succeeded in
interesting and pleasing the American reading
public.</p>

<p>There are over 1,800 different titles in our
catalogue, and every title above reproach from
every standpoint. The STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVEL has been rightly called the fiction of
the masses.</p>

<p>Do not be deceived by books which look like
the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS but which
are made like them only in looks. Insist upon
having paper covered books bearing the imprint
of STREET &amp; SMITH, and so be sure of
securing full value for your money.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p class="no-indent center bold xxlarge p2">The Dealer</p>


<p class="no-indent p2">who handles the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS
is a man worth patronizing. The fact that he
does handle our books proves that he has considered
the merits of paper-covered lines, and
has decided that the STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVELS are superior to all others.</p>

<p>He has looked into the question of the morality
of the paper-covered book, for instance, and
feels that he is perfectly safe in handing one of
our novels to any one, because he has our assurance
that nothing except clean, wholesome
literature finds its way into our lines.</p>

<p>Therefore, the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer is a careful and wise tradesman, and it
is fair to assume selects the other articles he
has for sale with the same degree of intelligence
as he does his paper-covered books.</p>

<p>Deal with the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer.</p>
